<p><span class="firstword">The</span> subject of which this book treats&mdash;"Popular
Amusements"&mdash;is one of grave
interest to the Church and to society in general.
The Discipline of the Methodist Episcopal Church
has always required its members and probationers,
as an evidence of religious earnestness, to refrain
from "such diversions as can not be used in the
name of the Lord Jesus," and also from "singing
those songs or reading those books which do not
tend to the knowledge or love of God." In the
following passages of Holy Scripture, worldly
amusements or pleasures are denounced by God:
"He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man."
"Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
pleasure, that dwellest carelessly." The consequences
referred to in this quotation are stated
in the following verses of the chapter. Being
"lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,"
is classed by Timothy as one of the worst attributes
of wicked men. How terrible is this statement:
"But she that liveth in pleasure is dead
while she liveth!" Consider, also, this Scripture
precept: "And whatsoever ye do in word or deed,
do all in the name of the Lord Jesus." In view
of these and like Scripture utterances, how is
it possible to believe that exciting, dissipating,
worldly amusements are compatible with spiritual
life or devotional enjoyment?</p>

<p>The experience of multitudes corresponds with
these teachings of the Discipline and the Bible.
Take this instance. On one occasion Mr. Charles
Wesley was warning the people against so-called
"harmless diversions," and declared that by them
he had been kept dead to God, asleep in the arms
of Satan, and secure in a state of damnation for
eighteen years. There were three ministers present
besides Mr. Wesley. Mr. Meriton cried out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
"And I for twenty-five!" "And I," exclaimed
Mr. Thompson, "for thirty-five!" "And I,"
added Mr. Bennett, "for about seventy!" These
cases of Christian ministers suggest how general
and how baleful is the influence of these diversions.</p>

<p>This evil, perhaps, is not peculiar to any clime
or age. Diversions, indeed, change with the times.
The fashionable follies of the last century are now
deemed matters of wonder and derision, just as
the follies of our day may be laughed at a hundred
years hence. But worldliness, fashion, and
frivolity are always at work inventing questionable
pleasures and ingenious arguments for their defense.
Possibly it is unreasonable to expect but
one opinion as to what is allowable in the way of
recreation. As there are various degrees of knowledge
and piety in the Church, and various degrees
of conscientiousness among even those who do not
profess religion, there will be conflicting opinions
on the subject, one condemning what another defends,
and each wondering at the scrupulousness or
the laxity of his neighbor. On this, as on all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
subjects, Christians should judge each other charitably,
but by the Scripture standard.</p>

<p>This little volume takes what I believe to be
the true ground in regard to the diversions discussed
in it&mdash;the only ground which is defensible
in theory and safe in practice. The Methodist
Episcopal Church is strong in numbers, in wealth,
and in social position. If we maintain the strict
morals and the deep spirituality&mdash;and they go together&mdash;which
have hitherto been our aim, we
shall be in the years to come, in the hands of
God, an instrumentality of unlimited power for
good. If, on the other hand, we become weak in
our belief and lax in discipline, the members of
the Church fashionable and frivolous, and the ministers
doubtful and indefinite in doctrine, and feeble
in utterance, we shall lose the position we have
held among the Churches of the Lord Jesus Christ,
and God will raise up another people to take our
place and our crown. But we trust in God we
shall never, as a Church, be moved from our old
foundation in doctrines or in morals. Though
worldliness and unbelief may continue to assail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
her, yet the Church is strong in that power which
overcomes the world.</p>

<p>Recently the advocates of popular amusements
have been both bold and insidious. They have
used the pulpit, the press, and so-called "Christian
Associations" to propagate their views. In
some cases they recommend what are considered
the less objectionable diversions to prevent indulgence
in the more objectionable ones&mdash;on the
principle "of two evils choose the less." But in
morals the lesser evil always tends to introduce
the greater. The proposition, therefore, is a most
mischievous one. To those individuals among us
who have been disturbed in their religious convictions
on this question, by the deceptive pleas of
those who defend or advocate worldly amusements,
this book will be found an effective helper. In it
Dr. Crane speaks the sentiments of the Methodist
Church. We believe the position we have hitherto
held on this subject is Scriptural and safe,
and that, rigid as the world deems it, our disciplinary
rule is wise and needful.</p>

<p>These fashionable diversions are not necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
for the health of the body or mind, but are harmful
to both. All the recreation that any pious,
sensible person needs is provided in the variety
of his duties, and the many and ample sources
of rational enjoyment. Does the studious, hardworking
minister need recreation? Let him find
it in turning from the severe study of theology
to biography, or poetry, or rhetoric, or logic?
Does he need a still greater change? Let him
take up for the time being astronomy, or geology,
or history. Does he need physical as well as
mental relaxation and change? Certainly he can
find them in his pastoral work&mdash;in visiting the
sick, in instructing childhood, in looking after the
general interests of the Church, in walking, or
riding, or attending to the interests of his family,
or enjoying their society. Surely, here is a vast
realm in which he can find rest and recreation
both for soul and body, and grow wiser and better
all the while. Does the layman of the Church
need recreation as a relief from the monotonous
and exhausting labors and cares that come upon
him daily? Let him find it in gardening, in cultivating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
flowers, in reading, in music, in Christian
activities, in domestic offices and intercourse, in
social visiting, in attending instructive lectures,
in attending devotional meetings. These are rational,
spiritual, satisfying enjoyments. None but
the weak, who think more of conformity to the
world than of conformity to Christ, hanker after
any other.</p>

<p>Dr. Crane has treated this subject clearly,
Methodistically, and Scripturally. The book is a
timely and useful addition to the literature of the
Church. I trust the publishers will put it in an
attractive form, and that it will have an extensive
circulation, do good to many souls, and bring
much glory to God.</p>

<h3>RECREATION A GOOD THING.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls,
playing in the streets thereof.</i>" Zech. viii, 5.</div>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> prophet thus, as with a single
stroke of his pencil, paints a beautiful
picture of peace, plenty, and public security.
In times of riot and wild disorder, the children
are kept within doors, that they may be
out of the way of harm. In time of war,
children may be seen in the streets of the
city; but they are there clinging in terror to
the hands of their parents, and surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
by the confusion and alarm of a population
flying from the foe. When famine reigns, a
few children may be found in the streets;
but they are the wan, emaciated victims of
hunger, who wander from their desolate homes
to beg, with tears and outstretched hands, for
bread. If the war or the famine continue its
ravages, the number of children steadily decreases.
In seasons of public calamity, little
children die, as the tender blossoms of Spring
perish beneath the volleys of untimely hail.
In the prophetic picture, therefore, the numbers
of the children, their merry sports, and
the public places where they are playing, all
give token of the safety and prosperity of a
people whom the Lord protects and blesses.</p>

<p>But if this be so, it can not be wrong for
boys and girls to play. A doubt upon this
point would mar the representation and destroy
the force of the imagery. No, let the
children play&mdash;not, indeed, without limit; not
to the neglect of study, nor of such useful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
labor as they ought to perform; not in modes
that transgress Divine law, nor in the company
of those who will teach them corrupt
language and evil deeds: still, let the children
play. Let them leap, and laugh, and shout.
Let them have their playthings and their pets.
Let them not fear the sun nor the winds of
heaven, though their cheeks ripen like peaches
in the light and the heat, and though faces
and garments occasionally show that man still
retains an affinity for the dust whence he was
originally taken.</p>

<p>Let the youth have their seasons of recreation.
Their amusements, indeed, ought to be
of a higher intellectual type than those of
little children. Nevertheless, amusements are
still lawful and expedient. Let there be times
when the student shall lay aside the book, and
the clerk, the apprentice, and the farmer's
boys and girls forget their work. Let the
youth, rich or poor, humble or exalted, at
home beneath the parental roof, or in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
employ or under the care of strangers, have
their periods of rest and recreation. And if
the time and the mode are wisely chosen,
there will be no loss but a real gain to all
concerned. The student will return to the
lesson with a better courage and a clearer
brain, and the fingers which are busy with the
affairs of the house, the office, the shop, or
the field will ply their task more nimbly.</p>

<p>Let middle life, too, immersed, as it is, in
the cares and toils of this busy existence,
have its hours of leisure and freedom. Brain
and muscles both need rest, and the burden
will feel the lighter for being occasionally laid
aside. Industry is indeed a virtue. Let every
man, woman, and child have something
useful to do, and do it. I would not, for one
moment even, seem to defend idleness, or
apologize for the follies of the aimless devotee
of shallow pleasures; yet I am persuaded that
not a few of our most valued workers in fields
of lofty usefulness would find their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
growing gray less rapidly if they could be induced
to take an occasional rest.</p>

<p>And let the aged, also, have their recreations.
It is not unbecoming for them
to devote an hour, now and then, to the
quiet pleasures which smooth the brow and
wreathe the lip with smiles. In itself it is
just as pious to laugh as to weep, and there
are a great many cases where it is wiser
and better to laugh. For the old and the
young there are social enjoyments and recreations
which brighten the passing moments
and leave no shadow behind them; which
send us back to the graver employments of
life with a lighter heart and stronger frame.
Travelers sometimes tell us that of all the
nations of the earth the Americans have the
fewest public holidays. This, if true, is not
much to be regretted. A public holiday is
very apt to be a public nuisance, disturbing
the peace of quiet people, and multiplying
temptations for the young and the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>less.
If there are anniversaries and days of
patriotic uproar, to which gunpowder and alcohol
alone can do justice, it must be confessed
that the multiplication of them is not
desirable. Moreover, if custom fails to prescribe
times and modes of recreation, it leaves
families and societies the freer to choose for
themselves.</p>

<p>But on what principle are we to choose our
recreations? Are we at liberty to follow the
multitude, inquiring, not for the best reason,
but the latest fashion? No intelligent Christian
will fail to see that he must be as conscientious
in his play as in his work. Ever
applicable, ever authoritative, the divine deposition
of the unchanging principles of justice,
safety, and right, the holy law is designed for
all hours of the individual life, even as it is
designed for all ages of the world.</p>

<p>The question of amusements for religious
people is one of the great problems of the
day. The very successes of the Gospel in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
our own land have brought upon the Church
perils which were unknown in the ages when
the victories of the truth were less decisive.
In the Apostolic age, when the world was
heathen, and God's people a little flock in
the midst of their enemies, every man and
woman was either Christian or pagan, one
thing or the other; the Church and the world
were separated by a chasm wide and deep, and
the only feelings common to both parties were
distrust and aversion. Again: not very many
years ago, in our own community, there were
few young people to be found among the
members of the various Churches. The gay
multitude pursued their pleasures with a reckless
extravagance and a giddy disregard of
the realities of life which alarmed the sober-minded,
and effectually repelled the conscientious.
The Church marched in order of
battle, all eyes looking for the foe, and all
weapons bared for conflict. The world, not
always in the humor for direct attack, went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
on its own way, strong in the fancied strength
of numbers, and sometimes tried to laugh, and
sometimes affected to sneer at the scruples
of the pious. Each was a compact force,
openly wearing its own uniform and arraying
itself under its own banner. The antagonism
was universally recognized and felt.</p>

<p>But in our own times, and in most sections
of our land, the truth has conquered. The
world no longer carries on a fierce and open
war against the religion of the Bible. The
Church possesses so much worth, intelligence,
wealth, and social power, that the worldly part
of the community feel that it would not be
wise for them to try to keep aloof from the
pious and set up for themselves. On the contrary,
the world deems it policy to nestle close
up to the Church, and in many cases it conducts
itself so respectably, and is so correct
in outward seeming, that it takes a sharp eye
to distinguish the one from the other. Not
setting itself in array against the truth, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
rather avowing a sort of theoretic belief of it,
the world, after all, is unchanged. Its eyes
are blind, its heart is hard, and its aims and
motives are "of the earth earthy." It wishes
to walk by the side of the Church, and hand
in hand with it, but with steady pressure it
draws in the direction of lax morality. Not
having received the heavenly anointing, it
fails to see how "exceeding broad" the Divine
Law is. It is constantly pleading for a larger
license, a wider range of sensuous enjoyments
than is consistent with the true piety which
transforms and saves. Thus it clings to the
Church, arguing, inviting, urging; and wherever
to its own dull vision the path ceases to
be clear, it sweeps off swiftly and invariably
into the realms of darkness and danger.</p>

<p>And the Church, too, is not in haste to
separate itself wholly from the large class
found just outside the line of strict religious
profession. We admire their intelligence and
amiability, their many worthy traits of char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>acter
and conduct. Their companionship is
pleasant, and we would like to retain it, and,
therefore, we are strongly tempted, for the
sake of it, to make concessions on the various
moral questions in debate between us and
them. Another influence is silently and yet
powerfully at work. Unless we consent that
they shall marry in the Chinese style&mdash;without
having previously exchanged a word or
even seen each other's faces&mdash;our young people
must have opportunities to get acquainted
and form attachments. In making their selections
they like to take a wide range of
observation. A deal of skirmishing generally
precedes the final conquest. The young
Church-member does not feel inclined to refuse
the acquaintance of moral, intelligent,
agreeable young people simply on the ground
that they are not professors of religion. The
young people of the world see that if they do
not keep near the Church they cut themselves
off from the best portions of society. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>out
violence no rigid lines of social separation
can be drawn between the Church and the
general community. The two parties hold to
each other, each inviting, pleading, trying to
draw the other in its own direction, in the
path of its own principles and tendencies.
The one is ready to yield all that can be conceded
without an abandonment of truth and
duty; the other, like Herod under the influence
of John's preaching, fears, and listens,
and does "many things."</p>

<p>Nor is it clear that utter separation is desirable.
We can be instrumental in saving
only those who are within our reach. How
shall we bring others within the range of our
influence, and at the same time keep wholly
beyond the range of theirs? How shall we
lift up others and yet not feel their weight?
If we drive from us all who have failed thus
far to come up to our standard, we lessen
the area of our usefulness&mdash;we throw away
precious opportunities to do good. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Church, if faithful, is not imperiled by this
antagonism of moral forces. It must show
itself the more powerful of the two, and
"overcome the world." Surely, if truth is
strong, if fixed principles of action furnish a
solid fulcrum on which to place our levers,
we ought to move the world, and not the
world us.</p>

<p>It follows, therefore, that if the young members
of the Church, and the young people just
outside the line of religious profession, are to
unite in social gatherings and recreations,
duty demands that we stand firm, while courtesy
and reason, to say nothing of still higher
motives, require that others yield. No labored
argument is needed to show this. The
lover of frivolous pleasures can not plead that
religious convictions impel him to his follies.
When youthful Christians fear and resist,
saying, "Conscience forbids," he can not reply,
"<i>My</i> conscience commands." When the
Christian remonstrates, saying, "To do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
might imperil my soul," the other can not
answer, "<i>Not</i> to do it would imperil mine."
The worldly can only plead that they see no
evil where others see it, and that they are
ready to venture where others fear to go.
Thus they virtually confess that they are dull
in vision and hard in heart.</p>

<p>And so we can not come down to the level
to which they would invite us. If they desire
us to meet on common ground, we must be
permitted to select the place. If we yield
to them, we sacrifice our principles and our
peace. If they yield to us, they lose, at the
utmost, only a little temporary pleasure. Let
the worldly and the gay, therefore, say no
more about our Puritanic notions. They see,
and ought to confess, that almost of necessity
they tend to place the standard of morals too
low, and that when the Church and the world
differ in regard to what is allowable and right,
there are a thousand chances to one that the
Church is right and the world is wrong. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the religion of Christ laid no restrictions on
us which the trifling mind and the unrenewed
heart felt to be unwelcome, or even burdensome,
we might well suspect that it was the
invention of men.</p>

<h3>TRUE RECREATION.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>And let them measure the pattern.</i>" Ezekiel xliii, 10.</div>

<p><span class="firstword">What</span> amusements, then, are rational
and allowable? and to what extent
may we indulge in them? We desire, before
we discuss specific modes of recreation, to lay
down certain general principles, and indicate
what we believe to be the true method of
reasoning on the subject, so that the reader,
keeping these in mind, will see why we approve
or condemn hereafter, even when, for
the sake of brevity, the conclusion is given
in few words.</p>

<p>First of all, then, we inquire, What is the
true design of recreation? The mere pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ure
of the hour is certainly not the sole object
at which we should aim, regardless of
all other considerations. A degree of enjoyment
may be desirable; and yet the temporary
pleasure is not all. The true idea of
rational recreation is expressed in the very
name. The aim is to renew, restore, create
again. It is to lay aside the more serious
avocations of life for a brief space, that we
may resume them with new vigor. It is to
make a little truce with toil and care, that
we may return to the battle with stouter
hearts and keener weapons. We rest, that
we may be the better prepared for work.
Rational recreation never loses sight of duty.
It teaches us to seek, now and then, a little
leisure, that we may be able to labor the
harder and the longer; to be gay and merry,
only that we may be the more susceptible, in
its time, of all solemn, holy emotion. Recreation,
in the true sense of the term, is not only
free from evil, but it is full of good intents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
aiming, above all, to aid us in the great concerns
which look beyond the horizon of the
present life. We shake off care, but not conscience.
We do not lay aside the service of
God and take a day to ourselves, but strive
to win the benediction pronounced upon "the
man that feareth always."</p>

<p>To make the discussion as practical as possible,
we name eight different points of view
from which we may consider any diversion
proposed to us:</p>

<p>1. <i>Our recreations should be innocent in
themselves.</i></p>

<p>Compared with eternal interests, present
enjoyment is as dust in the balance. However
exhilarating or beneficial to health the
advocates of any amusement may claim that
their favorite diversion is, if there be an element
of wrong in it, it must be condemned
without hesitation or reserve. If it involves
any transgression of Divine law; if it leads
us to disregard the welfare of our fellow; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the pleasure is purchased by pain wantonly
inflicted upon man, or beast, or bird, or insect;
if it tends to render us frivolous or
reckless, or in any way leaves us farther from
God and heaven, less conscientious, less devotional,
less tender in heart, less active and
earnest in all good works, we must condemn
it, no matter how fascinating it may be, no
matter what may be the numbers or the
social position of those who favor it. Of all
the poor excuses for sin, one of the poorest
and meanest is the plea that we trampled on
the law of God and defied his justice for the
sake of amusement.</p>

<p>2. <i>Our recreations must never be suffered to
lessen our influence as followers of Christ.</i></p>

<p>A good name is an element of strength.
Unless those around us have confidence in
our sincerity, we are shorn of our moral
power. No matter how clear our integrity
may be in our own eyes, if we fail to convince
the world of it; if we seem to be less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
careful of obligation, less mindful of the right
than Christians should be, there will be a
cloud of distrust hovering about us wherever
we are, and we will find ourselves shut out
of some of the noblest fields of effort. The
world watches our recreations as well as our
more weighty employments. We need not,
indeed, be governed always by the reproaches
of the censorious and the complaints of the
morose; still, it is never safe to be indifferent
to popular opinion. Even where we discover
no evident wrong, we should not, for the sake
of mere momentary pleasure, give ourselves
to any pursuit which bears a specious name
or is surrounded by doubtful associations.
Even in Christian communities public opinion
does not tend to be fanatically rigid, and
we may be sure that what it condemns we
will find it safe to avoid.</p>

<p>Nor should our recreations ever be of such
a character as to wound our fellow-Christians.
It is true, you need not always be controlled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
by the views of this or that member of the
Church, who, perhaps, does not abound in the
intelligence and wisdom which give weight to
opinion. But what does your pastor think?
If you and he differ, who is probably right?
Look about you. See who they are in your
community who are universally acknowledged
as the real disciples of Christ, by whose aggregate
good name the Church stands in reputation.
What do they think? Where they
doubt, you may well hesitate. Even if they
should seem needlessly scrupulous, you may
be sure of one thing&mdash;you will not find it
dangerous to follow their counsel.</p>

<p>And you have no right to treat their admonitions
with indifference. You can not, without
peril, go counter to their views of duty.
Whatever may be the abstract right or wrong
of the thing in question, this evil effect, at
least, will follow your rejection of their advice:
you will separate yourselves from your
pious exemplars and guides; the chasm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
however narrow at first, will widen with time;
the society of your fellow-Christians will lose
its charm; the social forces which helped,
more than you are aware of, to hold you to
your duty will lose their power; the Tempter
will excite in your heart now anger at others,
now doubts of yourself, and the process, unless
arrested, will end in spiritual wreck and
ruin.</p>

<p>3. <i>Our recreations should never be so chosen
or so pursued as to interfere with the full
and faithful performance of the sober duties of
life.</i></p>

<p>Childhood and youth are not, as some
fancy, a period of mere waiting, a sort of
play spell before school begins. In regard to
the success of after life, it is the hour of
precious opportunities which come but once.
It is the foundation upon which the whole
future edifice is to rest.</p>

<p>If a child should never learn the things
which an infant one year old usually knows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
he would grow up in a state of idiocy. In
their very plays, as we term them, children
investigate the properties of matter, acquire
ease and skill in managing the bones and
muscles of their own frames, and learn the
contents of the great world, which is all so
new to them. Youth has its work, and all
after excellence is connected with the industry
and care with which that work is done.
The mind is to be cultured, the reason exercised,
the fancy curbed, the memory stored
with treasure, the whole intellect disciplined
and prepared for continuous, patient labor.
In youth the avocation is to be chosen, the
great problems of time and eternity revolved,
and the solemn journey begun. He that
would be wise must not dream away the
golden hours in empty visions of what he
would like to be, but rouse himself and prepare
to encounter soberly the great duties
before him. He has not a moment to lose.
He must look and listen, read and remember;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
he must reflect, and reason, and judge; he
must will and do wisely and well, and every
day gather strength for other days to come.</p>

<p>If, therefore, diversions are of such a nature,
or are so pursued as to induce an idle,
dreamy, inconstant frame of mind, making it
an annoyance and a burden to be summoned
to real work in careful thinking or patient
doing, a resolute grapple with the plain responsibilities
of ordinary life, something is
wrong. When the imagination has outgrown
the judgment, and the mind revolts at reality
and delights to dwell in the realms of fancy,
building destinies out of airy nothing, we can
see foreshadowed, as we look into the future,
only bitter disappointment and failure.</p>

<p>4. <i>Our recreations must promote health.</i></p>

<p>Health is the material of which efficient
life is made. They who squander it cut short
the day which God assigned them, cloud it
with weakness and pain, and lessen the practical
results of living. To do this willfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
deliberately, in the chase after mere pleasure,
is not a small sin. Our Creator requires of
us the wise and faithful use of the various
elements of activity and power with which he
has endowed us. If, then, the hours spent in
what we call diversion be followed by exhaustion;
if the evening of mirth be succeeded by
a day in which the brow is clouded, the frame
languid, the mind irritable, the whole being
disordered, there has been something wrong,
either in the nature of the amusement or the
manner in which it was pursued. To be well
and strong, if we may, is our duty. Our recreations
should not lessen but increase our
power to will and to do. They are designed
to sharpen the tools with which we work, and
if the process which we adopt mars the blade
our methods are bad. The value of the mode
is to be estimated not merely by the present
pleasure, but by the power, gained by it. If
the mower in the meadow is enchanted with
the rattling, ringing music which accompa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>nies
the whetting of the scythe, but at each
repetition finds the edge duller than before,
till finally he can not cut the grass at all,
he might as well be standing among those
whom "no man hath hired."</p>

<p>5. <i>Our recreations should not be unduly expensive.</i></p>

<p>Money is power. It may be made to feed
the hungry and clothe the naked. It may
be employed in teaching the ignorant and
reclaiming those that wander. It plays an
important part in all good works. He that
squanders money throws away the ability to
do good. He "wastes his Lord's substance."
In Christ's description of the day of Judgment,
the stress is laid, not upon names, professions,
and beliefs, but the tangible fruits
of piety. We must beware, therefore, lest
our self-indulgences tax our purse too heavily,
and leave too little for good deeds. The
hour is not far distant when the memory of
one kind act will be to us the source of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
pleasure than the recollection of all the selfish
joys of a life-time. It is to be feared that
some professors of religion, who lack neither
opportunities nor means to do much, will
make rather a poor showing at the last great
day.</p>

<p>6. <i>Recreation should never lose sight of the
value of time.</i></p>

<p>Time is one of God's most precious gifts.
It is the material of which life is made, the
field in which eternal destinies germinate, the
Summer in which divine things grow. We
have no more right to lay plans to "kill time"
than to kill ourselves. The suicide rebels
against the duties assigned him by Providence,
deserts his post, and throws from him
the years otherwise allotted him. The aimless,
idle soul, without a purpose or a plan,
whom no incentive can stir, and to whom life
is a weariness, because there seems nothing
for which to live, commits a daily suicide.
Wealth is no excuse for uselessness. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
children play all their lives because their
fathers worked hard from youth to old age,
they take rather a doubtful way to honor
their parents. If a man has no sober aim in
life, no worthy object for which he is stirring,
God will not hold him guiltless. Genuine
recreation harmonizes with all high and holy
enterprise. It does not make us drones, living
upon the stores which the working bees
of the hive have accumulated, but teaches us,
like the son of Saul, weary and faint in the
rapid pursuit of the foes of Israel, to stop for
a moment to taste the honey dripping in the
forest, that our "eyes may brighten," and we
press on with swifter feet. Genuine recreation
wastes no time, but, on the contrary,
treasures up the golden moments with a miser's
care. Diversions indulged in beyond
measure cease, therefore, to be recreations,
and become a criminal waste of God's precious
gift.</p>

<p>7. <i>Our recreations ought to improve the mind.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>They should not, indeed, burden the mental
powers; nevertheless, they ought not to be
childish and without meaning. There should
always be enough of thought involved to keep
the mind pleasantly and not unprofitably occupied.
For this reason recreation is best pursued
not alone, but socially. Cheerful, intelligent
conversation is itself one of the best of
recreations. The heart is improved, the mind
is roused into new vigor and fruitfulness, the
thoughts are wrested away from toil and care,
and smiles break through the gloom like sunshine
bursting through the rifted clouds.</p>

<p>8. <i>Our recreations should be productive of
genuine enjoyment.</i></p>

<p>The very idea of recreation includes that
of pleasure. If it leaves us sad or dull it
fails of its true aim. It ought to make the
eye bright and the cheek glow. It should
have an affinity for smiles, and pleasant words,
and mirthful thoughts which glance like the
play of the northern Aurora when the night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
is cloudless. It should leave memories in
which there is no tinge of shame or regret.
We attach importance to the innocent pleasure
of the moment, because the benefit is
derived in no small degree from the mind's
release from its burdens. A company of
school-girls, silent and prim, taking their
daily march with the mechanical accuracy
of soldiers, lose half the value of the air and
exercise. The merchant gains little who goes
on a solitary fishing excursion, and sits gazing
at vacancy, with his brain full of invoices
and sales, units and tens, while the fish run
away with his line. Let the young and the
old seek suitable recreation and enjoy it, in a
genial, happy, mirthful spirit. Innocent mirth
is neither unchristian nor undignified. If a
man can not laugh, there is something the
matter with him. Either his morals or his
liver is disordered. He needs either repentance
or pills. Some of earth's greatest and
purest men have been noted for their mirth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>ful
tendencies. Socrates often amused himself
in play with children. Luther loved dogs,
and birds, and wit, and laughter, and by his
rousing peals kept his lungs in good order for
his theological wars. Thomas Walsh, one of
the best, but not the most hilarious of men,
complained that John Wesley's wit and humor
made him laugh more than his conscience approved;
but Mr. Walsh died in his youth,
while Mr. Wesley filled up the measure of
eighty-eight busy, happy years.</p>

<p>These are some of the principles which underlie
the subject before us. It now remains
to apply these principles to specific plans and
methods of recreation. In the scales thus
constructed let us proceed to weigh the various
diversions and amusements which claim
our suffrages. We will look first at the more
public and pretentious of these candidates for
our approval.

<h3>THE THEATER.</h3>

<p class="center">"<i>Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be
burned?</i>" Prov. vii, 27.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> theater has its apologists and advocates.
It is said to be a good place
to learn history, human nature, and all that.
Some plays are declared to be "as good as a
sermon." Assuming this to be true, it might
not be out of place to inquire how often these
good plays are performed, and how they
"draw". What proportion does this good
sort bear to the general mass of plays nightly
set before the public? Questions multiply as
we consider the subject. If plays are as
good as sermons, how happens it that, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
rule, those who admire plays have no love
for sermons? Moreover, if the theater is a
preacher of righteousness, or essays to be
such, where are the "gifts, grace, and usefulness"
which are the evidences of its call
to the good work? There may be no special
lack of a certain kind of gifts, but where is
the grace? Does it adorn the character and
conduct of the performers? Unless these as
a class have been grievously slandered for
two thousand years, we must look elsewhere.
And where is the proof of moral and religious
usefulness? It has no existence. The fact
is, to plead for the theater on the ground that
its moral influence is good, is to act a bigger
farce than was ever put upon the stage.
When a young man, who has been religiously
trained, begins to frequent the theater, quiet
observers see that he has taken the first step
of a downward course; and if connected with
him in business relations, or otherwise, they
govern themselves accordingly. When a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
young man, whose reputation has suffered by
his wild and reckless conduct, ceases to attend
the play and begins to attend Church,
his true friends begin to have hope in regard
to him. All who have in any degree looked
into the matter, know that the disreputable
and the vile shun the Church, and crowd to
the theater, while many who are plying foul
trades depend upon the play-house, not only
to bring the victim within their reach, but to
undermine his virtue, lull his caution to sleep,
and prepare him to fall in the net spread for
him. Build a theater where you will, and
straightway drinking saloons, gambling dens,
and brothels spring up all about it and flourish
under its shadow. All manner of vice,
and villainy, and shame grows green and rank
in the polluted soil which it creates.</p>

<p>Some years ago, the owners of a certain
theater in one of our great cities, resolving to
conduct it in a "respectable" way, attempted
to shut out, as far as practicable, all whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
vocation was infamous. This they thought
would be easily effected by refusing admittance
to every "lady not accompanied by a
gentleman." This simple measure accomplished
all that was expected of it, and a
great deal more. The class aimed at were
indeed excluded; but, alas for the proprietors!
the consequent loss of patronage was so
great that the establishment no longer paid
current expenses, and the owners found themselves
compelled either to close their doors
altogether or open them to the cattle that
herd in the upper galleries. The fact is plain
to all who are willing to see, that the theater
thrives by the vice and crime of the community.
It is a buzzard that lives on carrion.
To succeed it must be content to be the
hunting-ground where infamy shall snare its
victims, and lead them "as an ox to the
slaughter." More than this, the performances
and the whole arrangement must be
adapted to the low moral level of an audience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
gathered up from the particular quarters where
alone patrons can be found in sufficient numbers
to make the play-house a paying institution.
A successful theater must be on good
terms with the grogshop and the brothel.</p>

<p>The whole thing is one of strategy and calculation.
As the skillful angler puts on his
hooks the bait at which the fish will bite
most eagerly&mdash;no matter what it is, worm or
bug, or artificial fly&mdash;so the crafty manager
of a theater surveys society, and considers
what plays, what style of acting, what style
of dress among the actors and actresses will
most surely attract the crowd. He is aware
that the really religious portion of the community
regard the Church and the theater as
antagonists, and look upon him as one who is
laboring to undo all that they are trying to
accomplish. He knows that many people of
culture and high social position regard his
profession as dishonorable and degrading.
These classes he leaves out of his calcula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>tion,
because they are beyond his reach. But
a great multitude remain, composed, in part,
of the young and the heedless, fond of noise,
and show, and excitement, and in part of the
corrupt and the vile, the hungry beasts and
birds of prey, who want victims. Among
these he must find his patrons and his profits.
In aiming to gather them into his fold,
he must gratify their peculiar taste. He
knows that he can please them only by keeping
them well pleased with themselves. Will
he do this by means of plays which, from the
first line to the last, brand vice as infamous,
and exalt virtue and honor? He knows his
calling better. The people who compose his
audiences do not come to the theater to be
made ashamed of themselves. They would
not listen to such a play, but would go out
of the house, in the midst of the performances,
angrily muttering that when they want
a sermon they will go to the Church for it.
The manager must set forth more savory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
viands. He must address himself to empty
minds and cater to animal passions. He that
undertakes to feed a flock of crows need not
provide either the manna of the Scripture or
the nectar and ambrosia of which classic fable
tells.</p>

<p>As the calculations of an almanac are made
for the particular latitude where it is expected
to sell, so all the arrangements and appliances
of the theater are carefully adapted to
those classes of society which are low both
in intelligence and in morals. Tragedy, to
be popular, must not only deal in crime, but
in loathsome, nauseous crime. Popular comedy
must ridicule religion, and show how
much better acute and crafty villainy is than
simple truth and innocence. Immodesty is
one of the attractions relied upon to draw the
brutal herd. The female performers on the
stage must expose their persons in a style
which would be branded as grossly indecent
anywhere else. Let a fact be stated in illus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>tration.
One of the high officers of the municipal
government of London recently issued
a circular, addressed to the proprietors and
managers of the various theaters, remonstrating
against the indecent costumes of the
stage, and urging reform. What the effect
of the appeal was upon the parties addressed
does not appear; but an actress replied, in
one of the public journals, declaring that she
is aware of all that the circular asserts, but
affirming that she and all the female performers
are powerless in the case, the managers
demanding the immodest costume as one of
the necessities of the drama.</p>

<p>It is not probable that the British stage is
more corrupting and immoral than the American.
There is not a city on the face of the
globe where the theater can live unless it
goes down into depths of infamy, and becomes
the panderer of all vice and shame.
It is true that a few, whom the world calls
moral and respectable, are sometimes found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
at the play-house, but they are so few that
play-writers and stage managers, having an
eye to the financial receipts and successes,
look in other directions, and graduate the
plot, and the sentiments, and the scenes, and,
above all, the costume of the performers, for
a lower moral level. Not seldom is the play
itself a weak, unmeaning thing, which is intended
to serve merely as a pretext for the
shameless exhibitions deemed necessary in order
to fill the house.</p>

<p>The theater will never be reformed. The
truly refined despise it, the wise and the
good abhor it. It must find its support
among the thoughtless, the ignorant, and the
vicious. It must be indecent or die.</p>

<p>And so it comes to this: immodesty is a
part of the stock in trade of the play-house.
There must be indecent exposure, else the
foul crew that frequent the theater, and upon
whose patronage it lives, will care nothing for
its performances. In vain is the genius of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
poets and authors! In vain are all the tinsel
glories of the show! Even the play which is
"as good as a sermon" will be a failure, and
its lofty periods be declaimed to an empty
house, unless modesty and honor are sacrificed
to gratify the lowest passions of the
most debased of human kind. Where did
any evil invention of man ever bear upon its
front the stamp of infamy in plainer, deeper
lines?</p>

<p>Why, then, should those who believe in
virtue sustain, or help to sustain, that which
can not exist at all except in alliance with
vice and shame? How can those who believe
in God and love his cause aid this engine
of the devil? Do they know how valuable
their help is, and at what a price the
engineers are willing to purchase even their
silence? When the infamous classes of society
find themselves the only occupants of the
theater, they will be apt to abandon it. It
will not then serve their purpose. Rats can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
not live in an empty barn. Thieves can not
live by robbing each other. The seller of
alcohol can not prosper long by selling to
the same set of customers. As soon as the
drunkard has lost all, his very presence becomes
hateful to the man who has ruined
him. A whisky-shop resembles a college, in
that it needs a class of freshmen to replace
every class that graduate. And so with all
forms of vice; they need a constant supply
of new victims. When one set of unfortunates
have been picked to the bone others
must be had.</p>

<p>And thus the theater is a valuable auxiliary
to certain characters, seeing that it
brings their prey within their reach. How,
then, can a Christian hesitate one moment in
regard to duty? By what blindness, by what
mode of self-delusion, can virtuous women
be induced to patronize an institution which
lives on the ruins of virtue? How can they
sit among the spectators, and look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
wanton exhibitions and shameless exposures
of person, such as would anywhere else crimson
every modest cheek with shame or redden
it with the consciousness of insult?
How can they sit among the crowd, while
eager eyes are looking down wolfishly upon
the brother, the lover, or the husband who
sits by their side, and foul hearts are wondering
whether he ever comes to this place
alone, and whether he is beyond the reach
of their subtle arts? How can virtuous women
consent ever to set foot within the walls
of a theater, when they know that the very
air is thick with infamy and death, and when
every one who sees them there knows that
they know it?</p>

<p>There is an old story to this effect: An
angel, flying on some errand of mercy, met
Satan, who was dragging away a monk, clad
in full canonicals. The angel stopped the
adversary, and demanded the release of the
prisoner, saying that his very robes showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
that he was a holy man, to whom Satan could
have no claim. "But he is mine," was the
emphatic reply. "I found him on my premises;
I caught him at the theater!"</p>

<p>Even heathen moralists and philosophers
have condemned the stage as tending to corrupt
public morals. This was the ground
taken by Plato, Seneca, and Cicero, two thousand
years ago. The early Christian writers,
the fathers of the Church, denounced the
theater. It is safe to say that the piety and
intelligence of the Church have always condemned
it. John Wesley, the founder of our
Church, gave his judgment in no equivocal
terms: "The present stage entertainments
not only sap the foundation of all religion,
but tend to drinking and debauchery of every
kind, which are constant attendants on these
entertainments."</p>

<p>Truly, the play-house is no place for a follower
of Christ. Like the Babylon of the
Revelator, it is "<i>the hold of every foul spirit,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
<i>and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird</i>."
And so we add the warning uttered by "<i>another
voice from heaven," "Come out of her, my
people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and
that ye receive not of her plagues</i>."</p>

<p>Even if the plays could be so far reformed
as not directly to cater to the vicious and the
corrupt; if the foul birds of prey that perch
aloft could be driven from the nests which
they have occupied so long, still the theater
would not be a good place of resort for those
who feel that they possess immortal souls.
The late hours, the expense of time and
money, the character of the general audience,
and the insensible and yet powerful effect of
contact with them; the premature development
and overgrowth of the passions, the
distaste created for the quiet pleasures which
are safest and best for soul and body, the
rapidity with which the love of noise, show,
and excitement becomes an overmastering
passion, too strong to be controlled by duty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
conscience, parental authority, or parental remonstrances
and tears, conspire to render attendance
at the theater ruinous to many and
dangerous to all. Let no Christian go to the
play-house even once. If the patronage of
those who go but once, "just to see how it
looks," could be wholly withdrawn, all the
theaters would feel the loss, and some would
be compelled to close their doors. Why
should you make even one contribution to
keep in motion the remorseless jaws which
have devoured so many victims? Why should
you lend your example, even once, to encourage
the inconsiderate and the inexperienced
to form the habit of attending the theater?
Why consent to act, even once, as decoy
duck, to lure many, it may be, to their destruction?</p>

<h3>HORSE-RACING.</h3>

<p class="center">"<i>And so shall be the plague of the horse.</i>" Zech. xiv, 15.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> horse is, doubtless, a noble beast;
but, by some strange fatality, all sorts
of thieves and cheats gather round him while
living, as do the hungry crows when he is
dead. Horse-racing may claim a place among
popular amusements, since there is probably
nothing, except an execution, more certain to
attract a crowd. In many of the States of
the Union horse-racing has been prohibited
by law, because of the numberless evils connected
with it, and the total absence of good.
Within a few years, however, the thing has
been revived under another name. State and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
county fairs are now held for the encouragement
of agriculture, and specimens of various
farm products are exhibited to edify the novice
and quicken the zeal of the ambitious cultivator.
Horses, of course, form a prominent
feature of these exhibitions. But a horse
can only be half seen till he is seen in
motion, and so little "trials of speed," as they
were delicately termed, were given just to
add a little interest to the show. These trials
of speed usurped more and more time and
space, until they have in many cases swallowed
up every thing else, and brought back
the old-style horse-race, with its crowds, excitement,
villainy, and vice of every kind, and,
in fact, every thing but the name. An "Agricultural
Fair" now means a plow, a pumpkin,
a pig, and two hundred and fifty trotting
horses. These fairs are almost invariably conducted
with especial reference to the racing,
and not unfrequently are engineered wholly
by the jockeys themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>It will hardly do for us to adopt the sneering
philosophy of Democritus, and find nothing
but matter of merriment in the sins and
follies of our fellow-men; nevertheless, these
annual country gatherings have a comic side
which one must be very blind not to see.
The first note of preparation is the posting
of immense placards, printed in as many
colors as ever Joseph's coat knew, and offering
premiums&mdash;ten cents for the best plow,
five cents for the biggest pumpkin, twenty
cents for the fattest pig, and one thousand
dollars for the horse that can trot around a
certain circle in the shortest time. Every
gawky boy who rejoices in the possession of
a long-legged colt, reads the flaming proclamation
with delight, and straightway redoubles
his diligence in training his colt and himself
for the grand occasion. When the eventful
day comes he presents himself on the spot,
sure of winning the prize, and of seeing his
name exalted in the county paper next week.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
He finds nineteen other gawky individuals
there with, nineteen other colts and the
same ambitious expectations. When they
have paid their proportion of the money
which is to become the prize, and have entered
in a book the names of their horses&mdash;names,
by the way, to devise which has cost
many severe mental efforts&mdash;a strange man
writes the name of a horse never before heard
of in that locality. The contest proceeds.
The strange man, who had been so still and
taciturn up to this moment, suddenly discloses
amazing energy, and shows himself an
adept in all that pertains to the important
business in hand. He knows tricks that make
the astonished rustics open their eyes wide
with admiration and dismay. He confuses his
competitors with his bewildering maneuvers,
secures every advantage, and urges on his
own nag with a clamor and an uproar which
drive the others into unlawful paces, or make
them bolt from the track altogether. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
short, science distances unsophisticated nature.
The strange man and the strange horse
sweep around the circle and rush to the goal
in triumph, while the twenty are seen struggling
far in the rear, a miserable conglomerate
of dust, disappointment, and profanity.
Meanwhile, the half-dozen secret confederates
of the successful jockey have been quietly
mingling with the crowd, betting with all who
were willing to risk their money, and, of
course, winning every time. Thus the concourse
divide into three classes, like the notes
in music; the <i>naturals</i> stare, the <i>flats</i> are
fleeced, the <i>sharps</i> win. The performance
being over, the professionals joyfully divide
the spoil, praising with infinite glee "the way
it was done," and venting their irrepressible
hilarity in stentorian laughter and clumsy
imitations of Indian war-dances.</p>

<p>The victims return home, the wiser ones
satisfied with their recent experience, and
determined to sell their sulkies and break<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
their horses to the plow. The fools, on the
other hand, are sure that now they know all
about it. They have seen a professor of high
art, and burn with ambition to be like him.
They buy little caps of the same pattern,
stick their hands in their pockets as nearly as
possible in his style, and converse only in the
phrases current in the stable. Their manners,
as well as their clothes, smell strong of
the horse. They devote their whole minds
to the cause. They know more about the
last race than the last war, and are more
familiar with the names of fast trotters than
with those of our great statesmen and generals.
They can explain the pedigree of some
favorite nag in a more satisfactory manner
than they can their own, and take more pride
in it. The tavern is the school where they
pursue their professional studies, and the
sages of the bar-room and the philosophers
of the barn are their instructors. In some
cases idleness, low company, and drink pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>duce
their natural fruit; the property inherited
from the dead or dishonestly obtained
from the living is soon squandered, the victim
graduates as hostler, and, like some devotee
of olden time, consecrates himself, soul
and body, to the service of the brute which
he admires. In others, the aspirant really
reaches the high eminence at which he aims,
and becomes a first-class cheat, learned in
horse-craft and equally wise in the art of
deceiving men&mdash;a restless operator in his
chosen line of business, whose advent in a
neighborhood is a signal for all to be on
their guard, and at whose departure people
breathe more freely.</p>

<p>The "Sports of the Turf," as they are
called, are a mere compound of fraud and
folly. Betting is the soul of horse-racing, and
a thievish desire to get money without earning
it is the soul of betting. How many
"trials of speed" would there be if, by some
method which man has never yet discovered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
betting on the results could be wholly prevented?
Vice in all its forms&mdash;gambling,
drunkenness, lying, cheating, profanity, rioting,
and fighting&mdash;are the natural adjuncts
of every race-course. Human birds of prey
flock to it from under the whole heavens, and
gorge themselves to the full. And with all
this evil it has not one redeeming feature.
As an amusement it is essentially low and
animal. If two horses run a race, any body
who is not an idiot knows that in all probability
one will come out ahead of the other;
and who but an idiot will care which it is?
What matters it whether a horse that belongs
to some branded swindler can go a mile
in three minutes or two? Why should people
leave their useful employments, and assemble
in thousands, from far and near,
merely to see one horse beat another horse?
The whole thing is senseless.</p>

<p>While there is not a single solid argument
in its favor, there are numerous and weighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
objections against horse-racing. It involves
a fearful waste. A race-horse is more expensive
to keep than a family of ten children.
The spectators who crowd to see the
race lose time and money. The betting, inseparable
from the affair, opens the floodgates
of a deluge of fraud and falsehood. It
fires the hearts of the ignorant and inexperienced
with that dangerous temptation, a thirst
for money which they have not earned. The
sudden losses and gains rouse the passions,
and lead to collisions, fierce and furious, between
losers and winners. The vender of
intoxicating drinks will be there, for he knows
that his chances are best when there is most
of uproar and excitement. The professional
pickpocket and the gambler will be there, for
they know that the crowds will yield them a
rich harvest of ill-gotten gain. The public
roads in the vicinity of the race-ground will
be dangerous to quiet travelers, by reason of
the multitude of vehicles which dash along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
furiously, the drivers crazy with excitement
and drink, and the horses wild with the
shouting and the lash. And children will be
there, their sensitive natures receiving impressions
every moment, their eyes becoming
accustomed to scenes of vice, and their ears
familiar with the voice of passion and profanity.</p>

<p>The members of the Church of Christ
should never be seen at such places. If one
of them attending a horse-race should die
there, by casualty or sudden disease, would
it be considered good taste to name the locality
in the funeral discourse? Would it
figure well in the published obituary? The
path of duty is so plain that none need err.
Let no one, for a day or an hour, leave the
rock and plunge into this abyss of fraud and
folly. Besides the open, visible evils which
cluster about a horse-race, there are great
gulfs of villainy which few know of, and yet
by which many suffer. Not seldom is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
matter of victory and defeat secretly arranged
days and weeks before the race takes place,
and the men who make the treacherous compact
win their tens of thousands by betting
in favor of the horse which it is agreed shall
distance the others. The habit of betting is
a vice which speedily destroys all truth and
honor. No amusement, so called, which lives
by betting will long retain even the semblance
of honesty. Horse-racing is certainly not an
exception to this rule. Its whole history is
black with treachery and fraud. No professed
follower of Christ can have any thing
to do with it, either in the way of active
agency or secret encouragement, without sin.</p>

<p>We can not close this chapter more appropriately
than by quoting the emphatic words
of Thomas Hughes, an able member of the
British Parliament and a decided friend of
the American Republic. He had seen in the
public journals the statement that certain
capitalists of New York were about to estab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>lish
somewhere on the Hudson a race-ground,
which they hoped would, in time, rival the
doubtful "glories of Epsom and Ascot:"</p>

<p>"Heaven help you! then; for of all the
cankers of our old civilization there is nothing
in this country approaching in unblushing
meanness, in rascality holding its head
high, to this belauded institution of the British
turf.</p>

<p>"It is quite true that a very considerable
section of our aristocracy is on the turf, but
with what result? Shall a man touch pitch
and not be defiled? There is not a man of
them whose position and character has not
been lowered by the connection, while in the
majority it ends in bringing down their standard
of morality to that of blacklegs, and delivering
over their estates into the grasp of
Jew attorneys.</p>

<p>"The last notable instance among our
<i>jeunesse doree</i> is that of the Duke of Hamilton,
who succeeded to a clear £70,000 a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
year, some three years ago, and who is now
a pensioner of his creditors in the ring, while
the old palace of the Douglas is at the order
and disposition of the celebrated Mr. Padwick.
This gentleman, at his Derby dinner
this year, entertained three dukes, two marquises,
and six earls, and I believe there was
only one untitled man at the board&mdash;all of
these under the thumb or anxious to cultivate
the esteemed favors of this 'giver of all
good things.' Just consider for one moment
what our modern system of betting has
brought us to. A reliable <i>tip</i> is that which
the most scrupulous young gentleman on the
turf desires above all other earthly blessings
before a great race; that is to say, some private
information which may enable him to
overreach his dearest friend or his own
brother, if he can induce him to take the
odds."

<h3>BASE BALL.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>And the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to
play.</i>" Exodus xxxii, 6.</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Base ball</span> may be made a very pleasant
amusement, wholly unobjectionable
either in regard to health or morals. Many
of our readers well remember how it used to
be played by the village school-boys. Two
of the best players volunteered, or were
elected by acclamation, to organize the two
"sides." The leaders tossed up a bat, with a
mark on one side of it, to determine the first
choice. The winner looked around the circle
of boys and made his selection; then the
other leader named a boy for his side, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
it went on, by alternate selections, till all
were enrolled. The bat was again tossed up,
to determine who should be "in" first, and
then the play began. How they knocked
the ball, and ran and threw the ball at each
other, and fell down in their eagerness to
avoid being hit, and laughed and shouted, and
grew hot, and red, and finally weary! No
crowd of excited spectators were there to applaud
special acts of skill, and thus spoil the
sport; no "scorer" noted down in his book
the number of "runs" or of "fly-catches;"
no representative of the public press was
there, to prepare an extended and eloquent
report, confounding simple readers with his
vocabulary of new terms; no body inquired
which side was victorious, and all were happy.</p>

<p>And in these later days, if a score of
young men or older men would provide a
basket of refreshments, and go out into the
fields by themselves and play two or three
hours, in the ancient and honorable way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
carelessly, hilariously, not even noticing who
makes the most "runs," they would all feel
the better the next day; and the wit and
humor elicited on the occasion would echo
in twenty home circles for weeks to come.</p>

<p>But since it attained the dignity of being
our "national game," base ball has become
a ponderous and elaborate affair. Rules as
rigid as those which govern the proceedings
of the Congress of the United States are
fixed, by general councils of men learned in
the art, and goodly volumes are published
discussing the size, shape, and weight of
balls and bats, and determining the proper
distances between the bases. Associations
are formed, who assume a name, devise a
uniform, and have initiation fees and monthly
dues. The formation of the club, the selection
of the members, is a very serious business,
involving, as it does, the fortunes of the
fame of the association in its future contests
for championships and newspaper honors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Young men are in demand who are willing
to devote their whole time and mental energies
to the acquisition of dexterity in
throwing a ball or catching it. Professional
players are found, who are recruited from
that idle, shiftless, and yet ambitious class
of mortals who are ready to work with the
energy of giants one day in the week at any
useless task, provided they have the privilege
of lounging about the other six days, boasting
of their feats and basking in the admiration
of all the little boys in the neighborhood.
These professionals train as carefully as prize-fighters,
and are, in fact, the same style of
men drawn mild. In some cases they hire
themselves to the club for a single exhibition
game; in others, they engage for the season.
Their pay is ridiculously high, considering the
service rendered. We hear of a club that
secured one player for a thousand dollars for
the season. Another player was induced to
change his residence from one city to another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
and was set up by his employers in a store,
with a stock costing fifteen hundred dollars,
by way of securing his valuable aid on great
occasions.</p>

<p>When the club is organized, there must be
daily practice for the benefit of the novices.
This is done often to the neglect of every
thing else, to the sore annoyance of parents
and employers, and when a good degree of
skill is supposed to be gained another club,
fifty or five hundred miles away, is invited to
meet in friendly contest. The newspapers
announce that the Exotics have challenged
the Cupids, name the time and the place,
and express an ardent hope that the weather
will be propitious. The eventful day arrives;
"play is called," and the contest proceeds
with all spirit and vigor. They pitch, they
bat, they run, they pant, they grow red in the
face, they perspire, they strain their muscles
and rend their garments in superhuman effort.
The scorers set down their marks, the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ers
of the public press scratch away at their
notes, the spectators applaud. Intense excitement
characterizes the entire performance.
There is no brain power to spare on pleasantries,
no surplus breath to waste in laughter.
Awkward episodes occur. A head is broken
by an erring bat, or a finger by a ball, or two
players, running with upturned faces and outstretched
hands to catch the same descending
ball, rush together with a fearful thump, and
fall backward in collapse. Perhaps proceedings
are still further diversified by the occurrence
of a little fight.</p>

<p>The game in due time ends, and one party
or the other is declared victors by so many
"runs," and the winners and the losers adjourn
to a hotel and refresh themselves with a
supper, of which wine-bibbing generally forms
a prominent feature. Speeches, too, are made
by the talking members of each club, expressive
of the most intense admiration of each
other's prowess, and breathing unutterable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
friendship. The reporter, who has been presented
with a complimentary ticket for this
very purpose, takes notes of what is said and
done, and the next morning the newspaper
lays before an admiring world the important
intelligence that "the pitching of the Cupids
was superb, the batting of the Exotics was
magnificent, the fielding of Jones and Smith
elicited universal applause, the supper was all
that an epicure could desire, and the wit and
eloquence of Mr. Brown's speech were equaled
only by the beauty and pathos of Mr. Jenkins'
reply." While an agitated world is laboring
with this startling announcement, the principal
performers stay at home and rest, or limp
wearily out to the apothecary's to make investments
in pain-killers and strengthening
plasters.</p>

<p>And this, forsooth, is the great National
Game. It has scarce a single feature of real
recreation. The overwrought excitement, the
excessive physical exertion, the absence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
mental ease and conversational freedom condemn
it. The publicity of the performance
destroys all the good that might otherwise result
from it, and, instead of play, makes it a
mere exhibition, whose aim is not rest but
notoriety, and whose effect upon the performer
is not physical renewal but exhaustion.
The game itself is not in fault. In its
simple forms, pursued in moderation, with
right associations, as a recreation, and not as
an ambitious show, it can be heartily recommended
to young men who need some active
outdoor amusement. It may thus be made
a very pleasant and not unprofitable thing.
In its preposterous form, inflated into a
"great national game," it is very laborious,
very expensive in time and money, and not
altogether safe for soul or body. It is then
not an amusement, but a pretentious and
useless display, whose highest reward is the
shallow applause of the idle and the vain.</p>

<p>It may be hazardous to one's reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
for sagacity to predict the downfall of any
fashionable thing on the ground that it lacks
the basis of good sense; still, I will say that
the modern bubble has been blown so big,
that it seems to me that it must collapse
before long. If I mistake not, there are already
signs of decay. Many young men,
whose names are on the roll decline to play,
and are active members of the club only at
the supper-table. They pay their share of
the expense of public games, and attend, but
find it pleasant and politic to perch themselves
daintily on the fence, to smoke and
applaud in the shade, while their hired substitutes
do the hard work in the hot sun. In
due time the novelty of the whole thing will
be gone, and then comes the end.</p>

<p>But if its having become an overgrown
piece of folly were the only charge which
may be made against it, base ball, even as
cultivated by the clubs, might survive for a
time. The expense is not in its favor. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
know of a club where the regular annual dues
are twelve dollars for each member. Besides
this there is an initiation fee to be paid by
beginners, and I presume extra expenses for
extra occasions. The club has a hundred and
fifty members, and the aggregate of regular
dues can not be less than two thousand dollars
a year. No doubt there are clubs whose
annual expenditure amounts to three times
the sum named. This certainly is a liberal
price to pay for all the good gained.</p>

<p>There is, however, a much worse objection
to base ball than the waste of money. The
vices which cluster about the race-course begin
to haunt the ball-ground. Thievish men
find that bets can be made, and money lost
and won, at a ball match as well as at a horse-race,
and the same frauds and stratagems are
employed. Sometimes money to the amount
of fifty or even a hundred thousand dollars is
staked on the result of a single match. Men
do not need to bet large sums many times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
before they are ready for any trick, however
infamous, which will enable them to win. We
have seen, in a former chapter, how a horse-race
is sometimes secretly sold beforehand, the
parties to the fraud betting accordingly, and
winning every thing. The same thing is not
unknown, I am told, among the ball clubs. A
match is in contemplation. A club of "champions"
challenge another champion club, and
all possible appliances and devices are employed
to attract attention, draw a crowd, and
create an excitement. While the rivals are
apparently burning with intense desire for
victory, and determined to contend for it with
heroic energy, a few members of the clubs,
without the consent or knowledge of the rest,
agree so to manage that the victory shall go
in a certain direction, and for a share of the
spoils thus surrender the one side to premeditated
defeat, and crown the other with false
laurels. I have heard of one case, where a
match game was played and many bets were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
pending, and interested parties secured a
given result by paying the moderate sum of
three hundred dollars.</p>

<p>In fact, so many vices are beginning to
gather about the "great national game," as
some foolishly term it, that every one connected
with it seems to be regarded with a
degree of suspicion. Merchants and others,
who employ numbers of young men, are
doubtful about members of ball clubs, and reject
candidates who are connected with them.
This looks a little hard, but we must remember
that business men want reliable, trustworthy
clerks, salesmen, and book-keepers.
When we are trying to learn the character
of a stranger every hint is of value, and a
thing about which so many things cluster can
not be a recommendation.</p>

<h3>DANCING AND BALLS.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children
dance.</i>" Job xxi, 11.</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Let</span> us now turn from outdoor diversions
to those amusements which do
not, of necessity, demand daylight and space
for their cultivation.</p>

<p>Dancing is one of these; and as attempts
are being made at the present time to introduce
it into circles whence it has hitherto
been rigidly excluded, we honor it with the
first place in this part of the discussion, and
propose to give it all due attention. It is
presumed that the advocates of dancing will
insist, at the outset, that we shall make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
distinction among the various fashionable
dances of the times. It is not probable that
any reader of this volume will attempt to defend
the "German," or round dances. It is a
shameful, revolting spectacle to see a young
girl whirling around in the arms of a man
who perhaps an hour ago was an utter stranger
to her, her head leaning upon his breast,
and their whole persons in closest contact.
This style is positively immodest, corrupting,
offensive to morals, as well as to delicacy and
refinement. How dare a young man propose
any such performance to a lady for whom he
has a shadow of respect? How can any
young lady, who respects herself, submit
to it?</p>

<p>But cotillons and quadrilles, we are told,
are different; they are modest, graceful, and
harmless. Doubtless there is a difference,
and yet they differ only as the varioloid differs
from the worse disease.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to prove that the mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
motion is sinful in order to condemn it; nor
need we assail the personal character of all
who plead for dancing, in one form or another,
as an innocent amusement. The abstract
possibility of its being so practiced as
to render it a healthful exercise may be admitted.
I am acquainted with a gentleman
of more than three-score years and ten, whose
erect form and happy face, ruddy with health
and radiant with kindness and inward peace,
are pleasant to see. Meeting him in the
street one day, I asked him how he managed
to be young when he was old&mdash;how he contrived
to keep up the life and bloom of
Spring amid the chill winds and gathering
clouds of Winter. In reply, he alluded reverently
to the Divine Master, whom he serves
in gladness of heart, as the source of all
blessing, and then added: "I take care of my
health. I take exercise. I rise early in the
morning, and among the very first things that
I do I put on a pair of soft slippers, go up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
into the attic of my house, and then go round
and round in a circle, on a gentle run, till I
am in a pleasant glow. This makes me feel
well and cheerful all day."</p>

<p>Now, if any advocate of dancing will practice
it only as our aged friend practices his
peculiar exercise, we bring no accusation
against his sanitary measures; we have no
controversy with his principles or his performances.
We will even go so far as to
confess the beauty of certain fancy pictures
of innocent dancing in the family circle,
wherein one daughter presides at the piano,
and the rest of the children whirl about
in their graceful evolutions, till father and
mother feel the happy contagion, and, starting
up, join in the mirth; and even the white-haired
grandsire looks on admiringly, and
keeps time with his best foot, and applauds
with his cane, and then calls the household
to order for evening prayers. We do not
happen to know any "happy family" where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
devotion and dancing live together on such
excellent terms; nevertheless, extraordinary
things do occur in the world, and this may
possibly be among them.</p>

<p>But all this does not shake the settled conviction
that it would be unwise to cultivate
dancing of any sort as an amusement, or even
to tolerate it. The reasons upon which this
conclusion is based are numerous and weighty.</p>

<p>1. <i>Dancing as it is usually practiced, and
will continue to be practiced, if at all, lacks
the elements of true recreation.</i></p>

<p>It is folly to talk of sending children to
dancing schools, and then confine their performances
to the family circle. Dancing is
essentially an exhibition which addresses the
eye of the spectator, and craves admiration.
It tends directly to cultivate the love of display
and of the praise which it elicits, a passion
as avaricious in its way as the miser's
greed of gold. Introduce dancing generally,
and of the youth who attain a degree of pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>ficiency
not a few will soon tire of the approval
of the little circle, and thirst for the
applause of the multitude. They who imagine
that they have acquired a grace and a
skill which can not fail to win the praises of
all beholders, will not be content to hide their
light under the bushel of home, and soon the
performances in the private parlor will be
considered of no account, except as rehearsals
for more public displays, and the ball-room
will be looked upon as the proper field
where artistic ambition is to win its laurels.</p>

<p>And in this form dancing is detrimental to
soul and body. The late hours which it involves
are a fatal objection to it. The confined
atmosphere in which it is practiced is
injurious. The style of the refreshments
common on such occasions, and the untimely
hour when they are taken, increase the evil.
The undue excitement exhausts instead of
invigorating the vital powers. The sudden
transitions from the heated ball-room to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
chill night air are not safe, as many an early
grave can testify. These things conspire to
make a ball or a dancing party a direct attack
upon the health of those who attend it.
Instead of invigorating the weak, it requires
vigor to endure the exhausting strain. A
single night thus spent will make its visible
mark upon the face. They who escape with
the least injury are languid and dull, and perhaps
irritable, for days afterward, while some
are totally unfitted for their usual avocations,
and require time to recover, as if from an attack
of illness. While physical health is thus
impaired or imperiled, there is no promise of
mental or moral improvement to compensate
the injury. There is no time for rational conversation,
and any attempt in that direction
would be deemed out of place. The liveliest
imagination can see no moral good in the
performance. The whole thing produces no
higher pleasure than engine-boys feel while
running in search of the fire; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
matter of aching heads and low spirits, it is
probable that those who run with the engine
and those who attend the ball are about alike
the next day.</p>

<p>2. <i>Dancing has had a historic name.</i></p>

<p>There was, indeed, in ancient times, a solemn
religious ceremony, which, through the
poverty of human language, was called dancing.
When Pharaoh and his host sank into
the depths of the sea, while Israel stood safe
upon the shore, Miriam and her maidens
came forth with timbrels and with dances,
and sang to the Lord a lofty anthem of praise
and thanksgiving. When David brought
home the ark of God he danced before it;
but it was a strictly religious ceremony,
nothing like the caperings and curvetings of
our own day. There is no intimation whatever
that Miriam and her maidens, or David,
ever danced except on such occasions. Pleasure
dances have been almost universally held
in bad repute. The daughter of Herodias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
danced to please Herod, as he sat at the banquet,
bewildered with wine; but the performer
was one who could lightly ask for the
life of an innocent man and a devoted servant
of God; and the royal spectator was a
tyrant, who could carelessly order his execution.
In Rome, and Athens, and Ephesus
the dancing was done by the degraded and
the vile, who employed it as a means of advertising
their profession. The dancers of
Egypt and India at the present day are of
the same character.</p>

<p>Now, I do not know that it would be right
for me to denounce indiscriminately all who
perform publicly in places of amusement in
our cities and towns, yet it is safe for me to
say that a dancing girl, however loudly her
fame may be trumpeted by the newspapers,
finds her professional reputation every-where
a bar to her reception into good society.
Why should it be so? It certainly is not because
of the mere publicity of professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
life. If it were, then Miss Dickinson and
Miss Evans, and scores of others, would find
themselves in the same condemnation, instead
of being honored and applauded. Why a female
public lecturer should be respected, and
a female public dancer despised and shunned,
I can not understand, unless there is something
in dancing itself, or in the character of
those who have made it their profession, that
has merited condemnation. Ladies of the
highest respectability go to hear the lecturer,
and at the close crowd around the desk to be
introduced to her; other ladies, certainly no
more scrupulous in regard to their associations,
go to see the dancer perform, and the
next day will not look at her in the street.
What makes the difference? Will the apologist
for dancing explain?</p>

<p>3. <i>A love for dancing parties and balls is
universally deemed inconsistent with the seriousness
and devotion which characterize a true
Christian.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Dancing is regarded as the favorite diversion
of the vain and the frivolous. Nominal
Christians may be found at balls and dancing
assemblies, but they are persons who have no
weight of Christian character, and exert no
influence in favor of religion. The world, unconvicted
and careless, rather likes such professors
of religion, because their example is
an opiate wherewith to quiet an occasional
pang of conscience. The worldly and the
prayerless think more favorably of themselves
and of their prospects of heaven when they
see that Church members resemble them so
closely. But when the worldly man is convinced
of sin, and desires to find pardon, he
never sends for one of these unfaithful professors
to give him spiritual counsel. When
the wicked are about to die, they do not want
prayer offered at their bedside by any of
these fiddling, dancing, wine-bibbing, honorary
members of the Church. They name
men and women of undoubted piety. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
suspect those who can join them in their follies
and feel no condemnation. They do not
estimate very highly a Christian profession
which exerts so little control over those that
make it. Nay, rebuke a scorner for his sins,
and in many cases he will seek to defend himself
by a sneering allusion to those very professors
of religion who verily believe that
they were making capital for their Church by
showing that it can not be suspected of being
"Puritanic."</p>

<p>4. <i>Dancing involves undesirable associations.</i></p>

<p>We bring no indiscriminate accusations
against those who love to dance. In almost
every community where it is cultivated to any
great extent, it will not be confined to any
particular class nor to any one moral level.
Still, if we are to tell the whole truth, it must
be stated that dancing prevails less as you ascend
the scale of virtue, intelligence, and religion,
and more as you go down to explore
the realms of ignorance and vice. However<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
numerous and, after their fashion, respectable
its votaries may be, there is a line above
which it never prevails. Like the deluge in
the days of Noah, it fills the valleys first, and
covers the low places; but, unlike the deluge,
there are elevations which the swelling waters
never reach, heights upon which the dark tide
never shows even its spray. In our great
cities, those sections which are recognized as
the homes and dens of vice and degradation,
the very region and shadow of death, abound
in dance-houses; and the sound of the violin
and of many trampling feet mingles nightly
with the noise of rage and blasphemy, and
the hoarse clamor of bloody strife. Intemperance
and infamy are foul birds which agree
well in the same nest with dancing. But as
you ascend the scale, not only the more gross
forms of vice, but the dance is left behind
long before you reach the highest altitudes.
The devotedly pious, the truly pure in heart,
do not dance. In all ages of the Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
such spirits have always kept aloof from the
follies of their times, and had "no fellowship
with the unfruitful works of darkness."</p>

<p>They who give themselves to this amusement,
therefore, turn away from the best examples
of pure and undefiled religion, and the
noblest, holiest fellowship within their reach.
They ally themselves with the worldly, the
thoughtless, the prayerless, the gay butterflies
of fashion and soulless pleasure. They throw
themselves among influences in the highest
degree unfavorable to sober views of life, and
the earnest, thorough performance of its great
duties. They voluntarily leave the rock and
the shore of safety to launch upon a treacherous
stream, the rippling music of whose
waters will soon cease, and the bloom of
whose flowery banks will soon disappear, and
whose current, silent but swift and strong,
bear them steadily away from light and hope
down to despair, remorse, and ruin.</p>

<p>Dancing wastes time, wastes health, scat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ters
serious thought, compromises Christian
character, leads to entangling associations
with frivolous minds and careless hearts. It
is as sure a foe to intellectual growth as to
moral progress. Young people who are famed
as "beautiful dancers" are generally good for
nothing else. The time that should be devoted
to something valuable is spent in practicing
posture-making before a mirror, or a
professor of the high art, who shows them
how to step so, and so, and so; while God
calls, the Savior waits, life wanes, and the
tremendous realities of the eternal world every
moment come nearer. Even Cicero, the
heathen moralist, affirms that "no man in his
senses will dance." The dancing-master is
the devil's drill-sergeant, just as the theater
is the devil's church.</p>

<h3>CARDS, CHESS, AND BILLIARDS.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</i>" 1 Thess. v, 22.</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Cards</span> are an old game&mdash;so old that it
is impossible, not only to tell to whose
ingenuity we may ascribe the useless invention,
but even to name the land or the age
in which they originated. They may be
traced, however, to Asiatic sources. For
many centuries the Chinese and the Hindoos
have known the game, and from them it has
spread over the world. It was cultivated by
the Moors in Spain, and through their agency
made its way into Italy, Germany, and the
other nations of the West. In some European
countries the pastime was prohibited by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
law. This prohibition probably grew out of
the superstitions of the times, it being an
article of popular faith that games of chance
were under the control of the devil, who gave
success to those who sold themselves to his
service. But cards gradually came into favor
among the idle and the frivolous; and at last
even royalty&mdash;as royalty was in those days&mdash;did
not disdain to indulge in them. Samuel
Pepys, in his amusing and instructive diary,
records that on a certain Sunday evening in
February, 1667, he found Catherine and the
Queen of Charles II playing cards with the
Duchess of York, and one or two more, the
rooms being "full of ladies and great men."
Addison, who wrote a little later, continually
alludes to the game as the favorite diversion
of the fashionables of his times; and such
it seems to have continued among the gay
and the thoughtless of English circles, till
about the beginning of the present century.
The love of it, however, was never universal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Horne Tooke, who assailed the corruptions
and tyranny of the English Government during
the reign of George III, and was fined and
imprisoned sundry times for his hardihood,
was once introduced to the sovereign, who
entered into a careless conversation with him,
and, among other things, asked him if he
played cards. "May it please your Majesty,"
was the witty reply, "I do not know a king
from a knave."</p>

<p>It is said that cards are stealthily creeping
up into circles from which they have hitherto
been religiously excluded. And here the
writer is constrained to confess his lack of
personal knowledge of the subject under discussion.
He is, indeed, aware that individual
cards have their names, and are called kings
and queens, knaves and spades; that they are
"shuffled" and "cut," and that a certain something
is called a "trick"&mdash;doubtless very appropriately&mdash;but
having no ambition to stand
in the presence of kings of this particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
dynasty, no desire to cultivate the acquaintance
of knaves of any sort, no love of tricks
of any kind, he remains in willing ignorance
even unto this day. Two or three times in
the course of his life, he has seen people playing
cards. First, one would lay down a piece
of paper with spots on it, then another player
would lay down another spotted paper, and so
it went on so long as he beheld the performance;
but the process did not seem to him to
be attended by any particular result, nor did
he learn, possibly because he did not wait and
watch long enough, whether the victory depended
most on chance, sagacity, or mathematical
calculation.</p>

<p>But there are facts which every body knows.
Cards are the gambler's tools. They are a
favorite diversion of the aimless and the idle;
they have a bad name among honest people.
If, as some say, they were introduced into
Europe by a physician, who adopted them as
a means of diverting a royal patient whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
intellect was shattered, we naturally infer that
no great amount of intelligence, or strength
of intellect, is needed to qualify the player.
And to this inference it is not difficult to hang
another&mdash;that the game is the fitting refuge
of men and women who are conscious that
their talents enable them to shine better in
silence than in conversation. Whether, according
to the rules of the play, a king is any
better than a knave, or a diamond than a club,
I do not claim to know, but I imagine that in
playing, wit and intelligence find little more
enjoyment than do the dullest and most stupid
of the party.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, there is no true utility
in the game. It invigorates neither body nor
mind; it adds nothing to the store of mental
wealth; and those ignorant of it lose nothing
by their lack of knowledge. Again, it is certain
that to some minds the game is dangerous.
They are fascinated by it, led into doubtful
associations and evil habits, and to ruin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
itself. It seems that the diversion is so barren
of ideas, in itself deficient in interest, that
it becomes necessary to stake small sums of
money "just to give it a little life." Thus the
first step is taken in the road that leads to the
gambler's hell, to the great joy of the demons
who there watch for victims. Like other
beasts of prey, professional gamblers can not
live by devouring each other. Idleness must
feed upon the earnings of industry or starve.
Vice must burrow into the granary which belongs
to virtue. The cool and calculating
gambler will be delighted to see card-playing
become fashionable among all classes of society.
He knows that of those who begin with
playing for mere pastime, a certain proportion
will be bitten by the mania for playing for
money, and thus be brought within reach of
his sharp, remorseless claws.</p>

<p>One needs but little information in regard
to card-playing to entitle him to the privilege
of heartily despising it. Introduced, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
would seem, for the express purpose of reducing
mental vivacity and culture to the same
dead level with ignorance, it bears the semblance
of an insult to any company in which
it is proposed, wasting precious hours in a
way which neither invigorates the body, nor
supplies the mind with a single valuable idea.
I do not see how any conscientious, intelligent
person can deem it innocent. Fastening with
a strange power upon characters of a peculiar
make, and turning them into grist for the
gambler's mill, no prudent person will deem
it safe. Indeed, the history of every gambling
den in the great cities of our own country,
as well as in other lands, shows that the
passion for cards, and the hope of winning
money by them, often becomes an utter overmastering
infatuation, almost worthy the name
of insanity, which renders the victim reckless
of the claims of honor, religion, and the tenderest
affections of our nature, and drags him
down relentlessly to his doom. Wholly barren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
of good results, prodigal of the precious
time which God allots for nobler purposes,
void of every element of rational recreation,
to right minds unsatisfactory and to some
minds unsafe, we need not wonder that the
degree in which card-playing has prevailed
at any given period of history, is a fair index
of the corruption of the age. Let no professed
follower of Christ defile his or her
hands with so suspicious a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chess</span> claims to be a more intellectual, and
even more ancient, game than cards. Its history
and its principles have been set forth in
goodly volumes. Poetry has sung its charms.
The lives of its famous players have been
written and their methods described, and a
whole library of its peculiar literature has
grown up around it. Its admirers trace its
history for five thousand years, and inform us
that it originated among the acute, dreaming
inhabitants of India. The chess-player plumes
himself on the aristocratic character of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
favorite amusement, as if it placed him above
the level of common mortals.</p>

<p>In some points chess is less objectionable
than cards. It does not depend on chance,
and there is little opportunity to cheat. Moreover,
where the players are skillful, it requires
a long while to complete a game. For these
reasons, as I suppose, chess has never been
adopted, so far as I can learn, by the professional
gambler; and, therefore, its historic
name and present social standing are better.
Mind challenges mind, and skill alone wins
the victory in the duel of intellect. Chess is
not likely to become epidemic. It is so deep
a game; it demands so much of time and
silence for the contest; it employs so small a
number at once, that the gay and the thoughtless,
who are in most danger from irrational
amusements, will care little for it. Still, if the
reader needs a hint, and is glancing along
these pages in search of it, he may weigh the
suggestions which follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Nobody who assumes to play chess at all is
willing to be known as a poor player. To
play well, or even respectably, involves a great
deal of study and practice, and the spending
of much time and mental energy; enough, in
fact, to learn one of the dead languages. The
game so taxes the intellect that it can not
be resorted to as a relaxation from mental
toil. There is no physical exercise in it, no
courting of the sunlight and the breeze; therefore,
it can not be made a good recreation for
the sedentary. It conveys no new ideas,
makes no additions to our accumulations of
mental treasure; and, therefore, it is a poor
business for those who need their leisure
hours for mental improvement.</p>

<p>Chess is not popularly a recreation, but a
<i>pastime</i>; that is, a way of passing the time;
and the time thus passed is wasted. Many a
man, bewitched with chess, which has left his
mind unfurnished and his heart untouched,
has spent over it precious days and years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
which, if rightly improved, would have made
him intelligent, wise, and greatly useful in his
generation. They who fear God ought not
thus to waste the golden moments. If the
regular duties of the day leave certain hours
at our disposal, these hours are too valuable
to be dreamed away over a painted board, and
a handful of puppets. The sedentary need
air and active exercise, which will expand
the lungs, and clothe the whole frame with
strength. Those whose labor is chiefly that
of the hands, need books and newspapers.
The student, the clerk, the apprentice, the
daughter at home, have more important
"moves" to make than those of the chessboard,
a wiser way to employ brain power
than to spend it on a laborious nothing, a
better warfare to wage than the petty antagonisms
of useless skill, a record to make in the
Book of Life worth infinitely more than a
life-long shout of this world's shallow praise
of checks and champions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Billiards</span> are simply big marbles, "only
this and nothing more." Authorities on the
subject inform us that the table for playing
the game must be twelve feet long, and six
feet wide, the top being of slate, covered with
cloth. Around the raised edges are cushions
of India rubber, and sundry pockets. Instead
of employing his thumb and fingers to shoot
his marble, as in the original game, the billiard
player uses a stick. There are two sorts of
sticks&mdash;a long one called a cue, and a short
one termed a mace. One writer confesses
that the cue is the thing, and the only thing,
for the expert to use; but advises ladies to
be content with the mace, "since to execute
finely with the cue sometimes requires the
assumption of attitudes which are not becoming
female attire, or to the modesty of the
sex." Just so. By all means, let the ladies,
however ambitious, stick to the mace, even if
it is "considered merely as the implement for
novices." Perhaps we ought to condole with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
the ladies on the distressing dilemma in which
this places them. The mace confesses awkwardness;
the cue is forbidden. They are
doomed to remain forever novices in the
higher art, or sacrifice delicacy to ambition.</p>

<p>But what is the game? The expert player
places his hand on the table a few inches from
the ball, and resting his cue upon it and bending
over to look along the stick, studies the
situation with the motionless attitude and
fixed gaze of a hungry toad taking aim at a
fly. Then with the end of his stick he strikes
the ball, which, if his calculations are correct,
goes in a certain direction, hits another ball,
and then goes somewhere else. And this is
all. It is true, to be able to make the ball go
exactly in the right direction, and stop at the
right point, requires, as our author declares,
"immense practice;" yet the higher achievement
attainable is to cause one marble to hit
another, and drop into a pocket.</p>

<p>This statement of the true character of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
game is about all that needs to be set forth
to condemn it among intelligent, thoughtful
people. It has nothing in it to inform, refine,
or in any way improve the mind. The only
mental faculties cultivated are those which
judge of distances, angles, and muscular
forces. To aim at skill is to sacrifice months
and years of valuable time to a very mean
ambition. It is the favorite device of the
saloon and the grog-shop, the bait to entice
men from their homes in the evening, and
keep them till midnight, drinking, smoking,
and telling indecent stories. There is method
and design in the pother which the newspapers
make over matches and champions, as
if the honor of nations were involved in the
success of those who volunteer to represent
them in petty contest. It is expected that
the idler and the spendthrift will be attracted
to the place; and in the crowd the seller of
alcohol will find customers, and the swindler
victims. Billiards figure very low in the scale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
of amusements. Associated as it generally is
with late hours, confined air, smoking and
drinking, the game is detrimental to health,
to morals, and to mind. Kept clear of evil
associations, there is nothing in it to attract
the intelligent and the thoughtful. And seeing
that the righteous are generally called
home when their work is done, the professor
of religion, who can find nothing better to do
than play billiards, need not expect to live
long.</p>

<h3>NOVELS AND NOVEL-READING.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>Of making many books there is no end.</i>" Eccl. xii, 12.</div>
<div>
<p><span class="firstword">What</span> is a <small>NOVEL</small>? A recent writer
thus defines it: A novel is a portraiture
of "something new falling within the
domain of fancy or imagination, with its interest
centering in love." If this be correct,
it would seem that a novel, as such, is neither
good nor bad, but is the one or the other according
to its own individual character. To
portray something new is certainly not wrong
if the portraiture be true, and there be a good
reason for the portrayal. There is a place,
also, for fancy and imagination in the legitimate
operations of the mind; nor does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
fact that the interest centers in love necessarily
condemn it. True love, such as God designed
to exist among the families of men, is
a golden chain which binds in the best and
purest friendship known on earth. Genuine,
honest, rational love needs to be cultivated,
not rebuked and repressed. It needs the controlling
and formative influences of intelligence,
reason, and religion, and may, therefore,
be discussed by the press and on the
platform or even in the pulpit.</p>

<p>And yet novel-reading has become one of
the great vices of our age. Multitudes care
for nothing but light reading. The bookstores
abound with works of fiction. The
records of our public libraries show that there
are more readers in this department than any
other&mdash;perhaps more than in all the rest.
The literature which finds its way into the
hands of our people, as they journey by land
or water, is almost invariably fictitious. Our
weekly periodicals, secular and religious, often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
have their serial story. Our Sunday school
libraries have been overwhelmed by the flood
of weak and washy literature till scarce a vestige
of sober history or real biography shows
itself above the surface of the wild wilderness
of waters. A whole generation of young people
are growing up, to whom solid books are
unknown, to whom the great historic names
of the past are but a sound, and whose ignorance
of the world of fact is poorly compensated
by their acquaintance with the world of
dreams.</p>

<p>It is a rule in political economy that demand
creates supply. As all kinds of readers
addict themselves to fiction, so all sorts of
writers press into this wide and productive
field, and exhibit results of every degree of
badness, with now and then something of
better quality. It is not easy for the young
to find their way through this labyrinth of
good and evil, the good little and the evil infinite.
The safest rule, in whose application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the fewest mistakes will be made, is that of
<small>TOTAL ABSTINENCE</small>. To declare that all the
wild fruit of a certain forest is poisonous, and
to prophecy the death of every one who eats
a single berry there, may be contrary to
truth; nevertheless, if nine out of ten of
the kinds found there are deadly, and none
but a well-taught observer is able to distinguish
between the good and the evil, the
warning to be given to the inexperienced is,
"Touch not, taste not."</p>

<p>In regard to novels this is often the only
available rule. But if we are required to give
more discriminating advice, there are four
maxims which are plain, and, if faithfully adhered
to, will, I think, be found safe.</p>

<p>1. <i>If you have but little time for reading,
spend none of it on works of fiction.</i></p>

<p>Your success in life, your happiness, usefulness,
and safety in the world depend upon
your intelligence, your good sense, your moral
character, your modes of living. What you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
are to be and what you are capable of accomplishing
will depend, in no small degree,
upon what you know. You require solid information.
You need to learn ten thousand
things which are to be found in books. Your
usefulness in the circles to which you belong
and your position in the community are intimately
connected with the degree in which
you improve your mind. You have much to
do. You have no time to waste on counterfeit
coin while golden treasures of knowledge
woo you on every side. Read your Bibles.
Read history, the records of the past, and
the accounts of current events. Read the
biographies of good men and women. Read
books of science. Push your researches in
every direction, delve in every mine that
opens before you. Traverse every rich field
that invites your footsteps. Discipline your
mind, store your memory; train your will to
all high resolves. If your lot in life is such
that little time can be given to intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
culture, do not waste an hour on the idle
dreams of the novelists.</p>

<p>2. <i>In any case read only the best works of
fiction.</i></p>

<p>Supposing that the time which you are
able to devote to books is not narrowed down
to an occasional leisure hour, and you feel
disposed to glance at the department of fiction,
read only the best. Books are companions.
Choose your company wisely. Where
a multitude surround you, the pious and the
profane, the virtuous and the vile, the refined
and the brutish, it is madness to associate
with all that come. You know what the effect
upon your good name would be if you
were seen walking arm in arm with those
whose very presence is dishonor. There are
books so vile that the mere possession of
them is fatal to reputation. You will find
people whose minds are so empty, and whose
talk is so frivolous, that the time spent in
their society is lost. There are many books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
of the same sort. You will meet still other
people with whom you can not spend an
hour without feeling that you have learned
something worth knowing, that you have received
an impulse in the direction of the true,
the beautiful, and the good, and that you are
wiser, purer, stronger because of the interview.
There are books of this kind also.
For the same reason, then, that you keep the
best company to which you have access, read
the best books within your reach. They will
influence you as certainly as will living associates.</p>

<p>There are some few works of fiction which
are well written and true to nature, and which
inculcate the right and condemn the wrong.
If you read fiction at all, read these. I do
not name them, because I am not willing to
be held responsible for all the time which
might possibly be spent over them on the
plea that they are here recommended. If
you do not know which they are, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
lose nothing by waiting till you are better informed.
As for the bad, their "name is
Legion."</p>

<p>3. <i>In all cases let works of fiction form but
a very small part of what you read.</i></p>

<p>Read only the best, and read only a few
even of the best. Or, if you want a more
definite rule, read ten good, substantial works
to every one of fiction, however good. The
best works of imagination go but a little way
in supplying the mental aliment which you
need. You can not live on the odor of flowers,
nor build up strong bone and muscle out
of rainbows and moonbeams. You will grow
in intelligence, sense, virtue, practical power
for good only by means of solid food. Portraitures
of "something new, falling within
the domain of fancy, with their interest centering
in love," may please for the moment,
but if you get nothing better your soul will
be as poor and lank as the lean kine of Pharaoh's
dream. Confining your reading of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
sort to the least objectionable of the class,
you must add another restriction, in order to
be safe, and confine the time thus spent to
your leisure moments&mdash;what remains after
you have given due attention to better
things.</p>

<p>4. <i>Cease wholly to read fiction the moment
you find that it begins to render substantial
reading distasteful, and the common duties of
life irksome, or injure you in any way in mind
or morals.</i></p>

<p>The man who has tampered with some intoxicating
drug until an artificial want, a new,
imperious appetite, has been created, is on the
road to ruin, so they have already done themselves
a fearful wrong who have indulged in
the intoxications of fiction, until they are restless
and unsatisfied without it, and unostentatious
every-day life, such as belongs to the
vast majority of mortals, seems tame, dull,
void of interest, so that the mind can with
difficulty be held to its common-place details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
and duties. And the same question may be
made a test in both cases. What effort will
it cost to stop? Will it require a mighty
struggle, an agony of soul, a summoning of
all concentrated power of will? Then summon
the power and form the high resolve
without a moment's delay, for life and death
tremble in the balance. Are virtue and
honor so far undermined that the victim is
ready to take refuge in hypocrisy and lies,
denying in public and indulging in secret?
Alas! it is to be feared that the work of ruin
is already done. At all events, only one hope
remains. There must be a quick and thorough
reform, a sudden sundering of the
chains which bind to the "body of death."
In the matter of novels, are you uncertain
whether the point of peril has been reached
in your own case? Try yourself. Lay aside
light reading; take up some solid work, and
see if you can so interest yourself in it that
you keep on to the end without impatience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
without a temptation to hurry over the tiresome
task. If, like the Hebrews in the wilderness,
you find it a weary march through a
dry land, where you are haunted at every step
by the recollection of the savory flesh-pots
which you have left behind you, be assured
that you can not escape too soon. The real
question is whether you are not too far gone
to escape at all. Error in regard to the reading
of fiction is fraught with so many evils,
that the rules given, stringent as they may
seem, are abundantly justified.</p>

<p>Let our young people be constantly on
their guard against the mental enslavement
which marks the confirmed novel-reader.
Common novel-reading is a fearful evil, and
against it there are arguments numerous and
weighty, which all will do well to heed.</p>

<p>1. <i>It wastes precious time.</i></p>

<p>By universal consent, works of fiction are
called "light literature;" and the name is correctly
applied. To produce them belongs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
light thinkers, men and women whose purposes,
principles, and convictions are all
light&mdash;the light-weights of the world of mind
and morals. How strangely the name of
Martin Luther, John Wesley, or George
Washington would sound connected with the
authorship of a fanciful story whose "interest
centers in love!" The names which illumine
the historic page with the purest light are
those which it would amaze us to find connected
with the authorship of ordinary fiction.
It is worth while to pause and inquire why
we would be surprised. Is not this the solution:
that men of real greatness, working in
thorough earnest, under the influence of profound
conviction, are too busy with the events
and duties of the age in which they live to
find time to spin out of nothing a dream life
for the amusement of idle minds?</p>

<p>It is evident that but little is gained by the
instructions of teachers so inferior as are the
great mass of novel-writers. Their produc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>tions
are too easy reading to discipline the
mind. They aim chiefly to amuse the reader,
not instruct, nor convince, nor raise him to
the height of a great purpose; and, in general,
the best that can be said of the best of
them is, that they confer pleasure without inflicting
injury. But whatever may be the
quality, you may be sure that excess in quantity
is injurious. The vast majority of novel
readers are young, and for them to squander
the precious hours is suicidal. Youth, wasted,
ushers in a feeble middle life and an unhappy
old age. They who sow nothing in the Spring
will lament over an Autumn which brings no
fruit. Novel-reading is simply a diversion, a
pastime, and to spend more than an occasional
hour in diversion, however innocent it
may be in itself, is a waste of time, too precious
to be thus thrown away.</p>

<p>2. <i>Excessive light reading injures the mind.</i></p>

<p>The novelist seeks to bear his readers along
without any labor on their part. They simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
witness the action, and watch the unfolding
of the plot. The author amuses them with
wit and humor; and, if he can, melts them
with pathos, or charms them with eloquent
description. He is the performer, and they
are the spectators. If he is one of the best
of his class, they may improve a little in some
branches of knowledge, provided they are content
to read slowly enough for the purpose.
But habitual novel-readers hurry on to see
"how it all comes out," seldom pausing to
consider the force of a figure, or the beauty
of an expression. Ingenious thought, keen
discrimination in depicting character, accurate
descriptions of natural scenery, nice points
of style, are lost in the rush of words. There
is a headlong race of event after event, shadows
and light, storm and calm, and at last an
end, a rapid panorama, little of which is seen
distinctly while it is passing, and still less is
remembered when it is past. The intellect
does not grow strong playing with straws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
thus, where there is no exercise of the judgment
on what is read, no effort of the memory
to retain any thing. The novel-reader that
does little or nothing but lounge about with
a weak dilution of literature in hand, will soon
become as soft and flabby in mind as in muscle,
wholly incapable of lofty purposes and
worthy deeds.</p>

<p>3. <i>Excessive light reading tends to unfit for
real life.</i></p>

<p>A devourer of novels seldom has an appetite
for any thing else. To do our duty well,
we must have our thoughts upon it, and our
minds interested in it. The heart and the
hands must go together, or the hands will
soon tire, and do their work indifferently.
What chance is there for the student who
indeed holds Blackstone or Wood before his
dreamy eyes, but whose thoughts are upon
the unfinished romance in his desk? How
can the daughter at home find happiness in
aiding to bear the burden of domestic cares,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
while her mind is in a whirl over some delicious
love-story, in which she has lost her
identity in that of the fascinating Lady Something,
with four desperate rivals for her hand,
and the crisis of her fate just over-leaf?</p>

<p>Works of fiction would be less doubtful
reading if the reader, after finishing the last
page of the story, utterly forgot the whole, or
remembered it only as we remember veritable
history. The loss in that case would be
chiefly loss of time. But as things are, novel-readers
spend many a precious hour in dreaming
out clumsy little romances of their own, in
which they themselves are the beautiful ladies
and the gallant gentlemen who achieve impossibilities,
suffer unutterable woe for a season,
and at last anchor in a boundless ocean
of connubial bliss. Nor does it require much
previous mental cultivation to enable one to
indulge in these visionary joys. The school-boy
and school-girl, the apprentice, the seamstress,
the girl in the kitchen, can conjure up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
rosy dreams as readily as other people; and
perhaps more readily, as it requires but little
reading of the sort to render them impatient
of their lot in life, and set them to imagine
something that looks higher and better.</p>

<p>In fact, the Cinderella of the old nursery
story is the true type of thousands of our
novel-readers. They live a sort of double
life-one in their own proper persons, and
in their real homes; the other as ideal lords
and ladies in dream-land. Ella, sitting among
her native cinders, is a very prosaic individual,
addicted to exceedingly prosaic employments,
and fulfilling a destiny far removed from sublimated
romance. But touched by the wand
of the good Fairy, Ella is transfigured, her
coarse garments are robes of magnificence,
the mice are prancing steeds, the pumpkin is
a coach, and she rides in state, the admiration
of all beholders, and weds the prince triumphantly.</p>

<p>The modern Ella, sitting among the cin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>ders,
has indeed no good Fairy to confer sudden
splendors upon her; but her place is well
supplied by sundry periodicals, designed for
just this style of readers. And so Ella invests
her six cents weekly, and reads, and
dreams. According to the flesh, she bears
an honest, humble name, busies herself with
a cooking stove, or a noisy sewing-machine,
and with all her matrimonial anglings, perhaps
has never a nibble. In her other capacity
she is the Countess of Moonshine, who
dwells in a Castle of Spain, wears a coronet
of diamonds, and to whom ardent lords and
smitten princes make love in loftiest eloquence;
and she is blest. But, as Napoleon
once observed, there is only a step between
the sublime and the ridiculous. At any moment
the coach of state may relapse into its
original squash, the prancing horses again
become mice, the costly array turn once more
to rags; and the Countess, sweeping in her
trailing robes through the glittering crowd of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
admiring lords and envious ladies, subside
into her former simple self, with the hideous
onions to be peeled, or the clattering
machine to be kept in motion.</p>

<p>How can the two parts of this double existence
harmonize? How is it possible for those
whose minds are thus bewildered, and who
have formed this inveterate habit of indulging
in sentimental reverie, to engage heartily
in the performance of commonplace duties?
The inevitable result of excessive novel-reading
is a distaste, if not an incapacity, for the
sober thought and patient effort which are the
price of success in every worthy path of life.</p>

<p>4. <i>Excessive novel-reading creates an overgrowth
of the passions.</i></p>

<p>The novel-reader naturally, and perhaps unconsciously,
becomes identified with the personage
in the story who is nearest to what he
or she would like to be. With the book in his
hand, and his whole soul for the time being
wrapped up in the exciting history, the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
man ceases to be the apprentice, the clerk, the
student, the farmer's boy, the plain John or
Peter of his real self. He is merged in the
hero of the story, handsome in person, brilliant
in mind, endowed with every excellence,
and bearing a name of at least three syllables.
He becomes the ardent suitor of the beautiful
lady, the heiress of the immense estate. The
burning words in which love is portrayed are
his words. The whole thing becomes so far a
reality that it has something of the force of a
genuine experience; and he feels happy, or
grows melancholy with the varying futures
of his imaginary passion.</p>

<p>Now, if Peter be a boy of fifteen, it is tolerably
evident that he is advancing a little too
fast in his sentimental career. Like a certain
variety of pears described in the fruit books,
there is danger of his being rotten before he
is ripe. He is meditating matrimony when
he has scarcely got beyond the limits of
marbles and green apples. He looks around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
at the little girls to see which of them is the
princess in disguise; and soon imagines that
he is desperately in love with some little damsel
in the neighborhood, and seeing that in
this dreadful world disappointment is always
possible, he begins to canvass the most picturesque
and pathetic modes of committing
suicide, in case the ferocious uncle should
interfere, as he did in the book.</p>

<p>The young lady is similarly affected. She
fancies herself the beautiful heroine of the
story, rich, accomplished, and, romantically,
wretched. She, too, begins to look about for
the model lover who lays his hand upon his
heart, lifts his tearful face toward heaven, and
says pretty things. She feels disdain for the
plain young men of her acquaintance, and
perhaps fixes her eyes upon some flashy
stranger, whose unknown antecedents give
her a chance to invest him with all the impossible
perfections her romantic fancy is able
to invent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this state of things has its ridiculous
side, but it is not healthy nor safe. The
effects are too serious to be passed by with a
smile. The inveterate habit of day-dreaming
thus created absorbs the thoughts, destroys
the mental balance, impairs sound judgment,
and produces tendencies which are very far
from the views and feelings, aims and principles,
on which usefulness and honor in the
world depend. There is an overgrowth of the
passions, an exaltation of marriage out of all
due proportion to other sources of rational
happiness, an overestimate of beauty, wealth,
and the other accidentals of human life; and
a corresponding underestimate of the value of
piety, industry, and the sober virtues which
are "in the sight of God of great price." It
is a vice of novelists as a class, to exalt love
and matrimony above all else, and thus create
in susceptible youth the habit of thinking and
dreaming of matrimony above all else. Thus
the novelist literally "turns the heads" of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
young people, inasmuch as he places foremost
and uppermost the faculty which the phrenologists
locate low down in the back of the
brain.</p>

<p>5. <i>The habit of novel-reading creates a morbid
love of excitement somewhat akin to the
imperious thirst of the inebriate.</i></p>

<p>The victim of drugs does not love opium
or alcohol because of its taste or smell. The
effect which he covets is, in truth, a mental
effect. He resorts to the drug that he may
feel rich, powerful, exalted, and happy, while,
in reality, he is "wretched, and miserable, and
poor, and blind, and naked." The victim of
novels aims at the same thing in another way,
by applying the bane directly to the mind itself.</p>

<p>But the inebriate soon finds that in order
to produce the desired effect he must, from
time to time, increase the strength of the
dose. He adds to the quantity. Then from
wine he goes on to brandy, and from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to absinthe, drugging his deadened brain to
the verge of death, to gain, from time to time,
a feeble return of the momentary joys which
once a very little of his chosen stimulus had
power to impart. The experience of the confirmed
novel-reader is similar. The simple
tales of innocent love which interest the
beginner soon become commonplace. They
fail to excite the fancy or stir the emotions,
and then something stronger must be had.
Quiet love and ordinary incident must give
place to fierce rivalry and jealousy, hate, revenge,
and murder.</p>

<p>The editors of certain periodicals belonging
to this style of literature seem to have
decided that the public mind in general has
reached this final stage. I confess that my
knowledge of these periodicals is not extensive,
being confined to what is gained by a
passing glance at windows and hand-bills,
where their pictorial baits are thrust out to
entrap buyers. The pictures which greet the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
eyes of passengers are almost invariably pictures
of somebody shooting or stabbing somebody.
The last embellishment which I have
noticed, however, is a cut of somebody strangling
the other somebody with his naked hands.
This is doubtless still more delightfully horrible
to the admirers of this style of writing,
and calculated to thrill them with a new sensation.
When the mind has become so vitiated
that it turns away not only from all solid
reading, but even from the less objectionable
works of fiction, to revel in nauseous descriptions
of lawless passions and bloody deeds,
and is so besotted with them that every thing
else is void of interest, and every duty irksome,
how far is it removed from some of the
worst evils of drunkenness or even of insanity
itself? How much worse is the victim of
alcohol or opium than the victim of mental
intoxication?</p>

<p>6. <i>The habitual reading of novels tends to lessen
the reader's horror of crime and wickedness.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>Crime is seldom actually committed until
the mind has become familiar with the
thoughts of it. The books which picture
passion and crime keep the readers in closest
contact with evil till the horror with which
they first shrank from it is gone. Moreover,
these books are sometimes written to serve a
special purpose. An author may be given to
some sin which places him under the ban of
respectable society. He grows restive and
malicious under the frowns of the good. He
writes a book in which his own vice is white-washed
into a sort of semi-respectability, and
made merely an amiable weakness, while
some Church member of sounding professions,
or perhaps a Christian minister, turns
out to be the villain of the plot. Thus in
one character we see a villain bearing the
Christian name, and in another a hidden vice
united with so many shining qualities that
the moral deformity is hidden by the splendors
that are thrown around it. Thus the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
reader is trained to look suspiciously upon
the virtuous and smile upon the vicious. If
he is tempted in the direction of any particular
wickedness, his memory will easily supply
him with some model from the books, who
was given to the same thing, and was a noble
character, nevertheless, the admiration of all
about him, generous, brave, and in the end
successful and happy. The inference of the
tempted one is naturally this: that he too
can yield and be admired, and in the end be
happy.</p>

<p>Aside from the fictitious respectability
which vice gains by being portrayed as not
incompatible with the possession of high and
generous qualities, needless familiarity with
the idea of crime lessens the horror with
which we regard it. The more suicides in
any community the more easy it is to commit
suicide, when rage and disappointment supply
the temptation. In communities where
every man goes armed, and every eye is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
familiar with scenes of blood, small provocations
lead to murder. It is not irrational to
assume that one reason why play-actors, as a
class, tend to low morals is because it is a
part of their regular business to personate
immoral characters on the stage; and when
the mind has become thoroughly imbued with
the idea, and the lips familiar with the language
of wickedness, the step from shams to
reality is short and easy.</p>

<p>Thus the press becomes an apostle of unrighteousness
when it lends its power to
make the public mind familiar with all the
phases of depravity. He that delights to
dwell upon the nauseous details is not morally
safe, and the vice which furnishes his
choice reading is the very one into which he
is liable to fall. The refined and the pure
shrink with loathing from needless contact
with the things which they condemn and
abhor. I believe that the fearful multiplication
of tragic crimes in our own day is due,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
in no small degree, to two causes&mdash;one the
too general circulation of a corrupt literature,
which familiarizes the reader with all that is
detestable and infamous in character and conduct,
the other the common use of drugged
liquors, which fire the brain with a wilder
frenzy than even that which is produced by
alcohol, and drive men to their doom with a
still more powerful, relentless force. In brief,
the increased prevalence of gross forms of
wickedness is due to a general poisoning,
mental and physical, which fills the minds
and the veins of its victims with a more
deadly venom than we have hitherto known.</p>

<p>An extract from a religious periodical,
which comes to hand while I am writing,
corroborates the first part of the statement
made.</p>

<p>"A young man&mdash;J.H.W.&mdash;committed suicide
recently in Indianapolis. He left a letter
to his brother, in which he says: 'I
believe that if I had never read a novel I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
should now be on the high road to fortune;
but, alas! I was allowed to read the vilest
kind of novels when I was eight or nine
years old. If good books had been furnished
me, and no bad ones, I should have read the
good books with the same zest that I did
the bad. Persuade all persons over whom
you have any influence not to read novels.'
The Ordinary of Newgate Prison, in his report
to the Lord Mayor, represents what a
fruitful source of crime the Jack Sheppard
and Paul Clifford style of novels has been
among the youth of England. Inquiring into
the causes which brought many lads of respectable
parentage to the city prison, he discovered
that all these boys, without one exception,
had been in the habit of reading
those cheap periodicals which are now published
for the alleged instruction and amusement
of the youth of both sexes."</p>

<p>7. <i>Excessive devotion to fictitious reading is
totally at variance with Scriptural piety.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>This needs neither proof nor illustration.
Genuine piety takes hold of the heart, and
draws the thoughts and the affections toward
God, and makes duty the source of the sweetest
enjoyment. But when the novel usurps
the place of the Bible; when secret prayer is
hurried over, or wholly neglected, because of
a burning desire to know what comes next in
the story; when meditation on divine things
is forgotten in endless day-dreams of love and
worldly splendor; or, worse still, when real
life is thrown into the shade by the unreal,
and made to appear mean and insipid; when
the action of conscience and sober reason is
swept aside by the wild delirium of mental
intoxication, what result can we look for save
apostasy and final ruin?</p>

<p>While I contemplate these things, I confess
that I am almost ready to recant the former
part of this chapter, and insert in the place
of it a rigid iron rule for the guidance of all,
young and old, learned and unlearned: <span class="smcap">Total</span>
<small>ABSTINENCE FROM NOVEL-READING HENCEFORTH
AND FOREVER</small>. Surely, there is abundant
cause for the rule of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, which warns all her communicants
to abstain from "reading those
books which do not tend to the knowledge
or love of God."

<h3>SOCIAL GATHERINGS.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>How can one be warm alone?</i>" Eccl. iv, 11.</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Time</span> would fail me to examine the
numerous and diversified amusements
practiced in various parts of our land. Some
are local; others are known every-where.
Some are right and wise; some are otherwise.
Some are intellectual and refined; others are
mere noisy romps. Of many of the older
sort the chief end was <i>kissing</i>. This latter
feature may not have been particularly objectionable
in little neighborhood gatherings in
the country, where every body had known
every body else all their lives, and half the
young people in the room were cousins. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
reader, however, will doubtless agree in the
opinion that in more general assemblies it is
not over refined, and may well give place to
something else of less doubtful propriety.</p>

<p>To go through the whole list of these diversions,
and pronounce upon the merits of
each, would be tedious and useless. My aim
has been to discuss principles, and then, in
the light of those principles, to examine some
of the more objectionable diversions now
pleading for popular favor. If those principles
are as plain as I take them to be, it will
not be difficult to apply them to any new
candidate for our suffrages. The reader, nevertheless,
may object to an abrupt close of
the discussion. He may say that this series
of trials and condemnations is not enough,
and that he is now waiting to be informed in
regard to the recreations which are allowable
and right; that having been warned against
the forbidden fruit, he would now like to see
the other trees, of which he may freely eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>The suggestion is not without force; and
yet it will require but a moment's reflection
to make it clear that I can not comply with
it. To attempt to make a mere list of the
names of rational recreations would, for many
reasons, be unwise. In some cases games and
amusements are local, and to readers belonging
elsewhere the mere name would convey
no information. The same name is also applied
to different diversions in different localities,
and, therefore, approval or censure would
be misunderstood and misapplied. It is evident
that a simple list of amusements to be
condemned, and another list of those approved,
would be of little service.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I should attempt to
escape misconstruction by describing fully
the amusements condemned or approved, the
whole plan of this little volume would be
changed, and it would become properly a
Book of Diversions instead of a discussion
of principles. That such a work might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
written&mdash;possibly not in vain&mdash;is not denied;
but it is no part of my plan to write it.
Nevertheless, I do not hesitate to offer a few
practical suggestions.</p>

<p>Permit me to say, first of all, that if any
of my readers have nothing useful to do&mdash;no
solid purpose in life, no proper employment,
nor desire for any&mdash;they are counted out of
this discussion. The idle, the frivolous, the
useless have no right to recreation. They
must reform their aimless, empty lives, and
by industry earn the privilege of rest and relaxation
before they are entitled even to hold
an opinion on the subject. Let me add that
no diversion, no amusement can impart more
than a momentary pleasure to the indolent
and the listless. A degree of hunger alone
can prepare a man fully to enjoy his food.
It is the sleep of the laboring man that is
sweet. True recreation involves the idea of
rest; relief, pleasant change of occupation.
So the active, the busy, the industrious alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
truly enjoy recreation. They who make
amusement their only pursuit will soon find
it utter weariness. For such I have only
pity, and for them I am not writing.</p>

<p>But the active and the industrious, who
"redeem the time," are entitled to their hours
and modes of recreation. So far from denying
it to be their privilege, I proclaim it to
be their duty. The time and the manner
must, of course, be adapted to their varying
circumstances. The school-boy and school-girl
need active exercise out-of-doors, in the
light of the sun, else they are liable to grow
up colorless and spindling, like vegetables
which have sprouted in the cellar. Every
one, older or younger, whose mind toils while
the muscles are inactive, needs the sunbeams
and the breeze. They whose employment, on
the contrary, taxes the muscles, while the
mind is comparatively inactive, require modes
of recreation which spur the intellect, quicken
the imagination, and store the memory with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
rich treasures of thought. Those whose daily
avocation confines their thoughts to a narrow
circle must find a wider range elsewhere, and
exercise their wings in longer flights. They
who work alone and in silence, need society;
and those spending much of their time in a
crowd will profit by an occasional hour of
quiet, solitary meditation. It was a curious
habit of the late Dr. Archibald Alexander, of
Princeton, to spend the hour of evening twilight
alone in his study, sitting in silent
thought amid the deepening shadows. Who
will say that it was not wise? What lofty
argument, what profound knowledge of spiritual
things, what emotions of divine love and
adoration may not have been drawn thus from
the well of silence and quiet waiting?</p>

<p>The chief recreation of the world at large
is <i>conversation</i>. Talking is the joy of the
whole earth. It is one of the great employments
of life. Our utterances are often more
important&mdash;do more good and evil than our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
deeds. All human wisdom, knowledge, sentiment,
wit, fancy, flow in the channel of speech.
By words truth conquers, reforms progress,
mind acts upon mind, heart reaches heart,
soul converses with soul. The lips may utter
golden speech, or drip with the poison of asps.
Human breath can come like the breezes of
Paradise, or blast like the deadly sirocco of
the hot desert. Aside from the deep joy of
worship, and the hope of eternal life, there is
no happiness, purer, richer, better than that
which springs from words. And there is
little true recreation which does not make
conversation one of its chief features, and
rely upon it as its great charm.</p>

<p>Conversation implies social life. And here,
in regard to social gatherings, I will make a
suggestion which I am persuaded that my
readers will applaud with united voices, and,
I fear, as unanimously disregard in practice.
Our social gatherings are apt to be too formal,
too expensive, too large to secure the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
which we have in view. To give a "great
party" once or twice a year, and astonish the
whole community by the splendor of the
show, is rather a poor way to cultivate genuine
friendship. It is often a fearful undertaking
to those who give it, and not very satisfactory
to those who attend. Long and anxious
debate settles on the list of the invited; and
when it is too late to remedy errors, it is discovered
that somebody has been forgotten.
The worry about the invitations, the arrangements,
and the weather, is a fearful tax upon
the time and temper for weeks beforehand;
and when the eventful evening comes the fear
that all will not "pass off smoothly" keeps
the host, and especially the hostess, in a
tremor of excitement, which culminates with
the assembling of the company, and finds relief
in their departure. Of the multitude who
move uneasily from room to room, it often
happens that the majority are little more than
mere acquaintances of the entertainers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of each other. Some are invited because we
know them well, and love their society; others,
because they gave an entertainment some
time ago, and an invitation in return for theirs
is a sort of debt of honor, even when we suspect
that their courtesy was only a little
device whereby they were aiming to get into
a new circle. Sometimes the invitations are
extended so as to include some who are almost
strangers, simply because a certain number
must be reached, or the affair will be
pronounced inferior to somebody else's party.
There is no chance for genuine conversation;
and little is heard save commonplace remarks
about the crowd and the heat, or inquiries in
regard to the old gentleman with the spectacles,
or the young lady with the curls. Some fail
to come, whose absence annoys and vexes; and
others arrive first and stay last, whose absence
could have been borne without a pang. Here
is one whose sharp eyes and sharper tongue
are the terror of the town, and who goes prey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>ing
about, making mental notes of every small
mishap, and every little awkward thing, and
laying up ammunition for a gossiping campaign.
There is another, who sees that his
or her turn to give the entertainment is not
far off, and who is carefully estimating the
extent of the preparations to be made, and
calculating the expenses to be incurred, in
order to be equal to the rest, or, if ambitious,
to outdo them.</p>

<p>I do not wish to visit these things with
ridicule. They have some good features, as
well as defects. They are worth something,
perhaps, though not all that they cost. And
yet there is "a more excellent way." If we
invite at one time no larger a number than
our parlors will seat, and we bring our friends
together for a good, social, comfortable, leisurely
talk, there might be less of display;
but would there not be more of genuine enjoyment?
Suppose, also, that the company
be invited by families, including the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
and the old, the parents and the children, the
married and the unmarried. Let the grandsires
draw their arm chairs toward each other
and pour into each other's ear-trumpets the
reminiscences of other days, and laugh again
over the old oft-repeated stories. Let the
little children, down on the floor by their side,
discourse of tops or dolls, while middle age
reasons on public events, or discusses family
matters, and the young people are gathered
around the piano or the book table; and as each
drifts about on the social current, the spectacles
and the curls impend over the same book
or picture, and the ear-trumpet be found gathering
up the voices that chatter over the toys.
Thus there might be true social pleasure without
anxiety or envy, without present uneasiness,
or heart-burnings afterward. Thus the
aged would be cheered by the vivacity of
youth; and the gayety of youth be tempered
by the wisdom of age.</p>

<p>Or, if any one fancies doing things on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
larger scale, let as many be invited as the
house will hold comfortably; and instead of
coming at midnight to stay till morning, let
the company assemble early in the evening.
And let there be music, and mirth, and laughter,
and leisurely comfortable interchange of
ideas, discourse that carries no sting and
leaves no wound, but fosters gentle manners
and lasting friendships. If the host chooses
thus to manifest his hospitality, let there be a
repast as good as need be; but excluding all
that can intoxicate. Moreover, before the
guests separate, let a few moments be spent
in praise and prayer, according to the pious
example of our fathers. And let midnight
see all the guests safe at home. Thus the
morrow will not find them jaded in body and
mind, and irritable in temper, but clear in
brain and warm in heart, with a tendency to
smile all day long over the pleasant recollections
of an evening thus innocently spent.</p>

<p>I own that I am not sanguine in regard to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the popularity of my proposed reform, especially
in fashionable quarters. Young men
who in the language of the day are called
"fast," will pronounce this way of giving a
party decidedly "slow." Mrs. Fitzshoddy
sees that this mode of procedure will materially
lessen her chances to display her newly
acquired splendors, and thus totally extinguish
her aristocratic neighbor over the way, who
failed to return her call five years ago. Fitzshoddy
himself has serious misgivings. He
looks up at the social heights he would fain
ascend, and shakes his head despondingly.
"That is not the way them fellows does
things, and you won't get among them unless
you do as they do. They have a crowd, and
a big fiddle, and a dance, and a long table
with a wheelbarrow load of silver and things
on it, and lots of wine, and all that. You
can't invite them to a hum-drum tea-drinking
that winds up with psalm-singing and prayer.
They would think it was somebody's funeral."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Arabella, too, who has of late given
her whole mind to the devising of gear for the
outside of her head&mdash;a cunning piece of strategy
to divert attention from the state of
things within&mdash;dreads so much conversation.
"People get to talking of things that you
never heard of, you know, and books that you
never read, and it is so embarrassing, you
know." And then she absolutely trembles
when she thinks of "Pa's" bad grammar, and
his habit of shaking the windows with gigantic
laughter at his own jokes. Many, too, will
admit the evils of present social customs, but
be afraid to lead in innovations. Some will
feel that to refuse to give a grand party, after
having attended a number among their acquaintances,
will look very much like repudiation.
Still, I doubt not that the intelligent
and the conscientious will agree that what I
have proposed is, as it has been already styled,
"the more excellent way." I know that it will
be hard to make the giddy believe that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
is much enjoyment to be found in these quiet
ways. They want a crowd, and noise, and
commotion. And in this they judge amiss.
This crazy rush after excitement defeats itself.
As simple food and regular habits best promote
health, so simple pleasures best promote
genuine happiness. The joys of wine are not
to be compared with the calm peace and self-mastery
which belong to the temperate. The
whirl of the dizzy dance, the wild excitement
of the race-course, the sensational tricks of
the theater, the whole circle of vices and fashionable
follies are poor in their results, compared
with the better pleasures which arise
from our nobler nature. They who would
enjoy life wisely and well, must not heed every
voice which cries "Lo, here," or "Lo, there,"
but remember that "the kingdom is within."</p>

<h3>APPEAL TO THE YOUNG MEMBERS OF THE
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong,
and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome
the wicked one.</i>" I John ii, 14.</div>

<p><span class="firstword">Before</span> we part, will our young Christian
reader "suffer the word of exhortation?"
I am not unmindful of the situation
in which you are placed. You have associates,
intelligent, agreeable in manners, and
not immoral, who argue stoutly in defense of
their thoughtless pleasures. Your conscience
resists, and yet you feel the effect of their solicitations.
You are sometimes almost ready
to wish that your parents, your pastor, your
class-leader, and your own conscience would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
consent to your yielding, that you might escape
the pressure and feel no conflict between
duty and the wishes of your gay companions.
Let me call your attention to certain considerations,
which I trust will have the effect to
strengthen you for the right.</p>

<p>1. <i>Frivolous and doubtful amusements have
always been condemned by the Discipline of our
Church.</i></p>

<p>Our General Rules do not indeed name
dancing, the theater, and the rest. Had they
done this, it might have been argued that the
Discipline allows every folly not specified in
the list. Our fathers in the Church were too
wise thus to attempt to war against an evil
which assumes a thousand Protean forms.
They announce a broad principle, which condemns
all "<i>such diversions as can not be used
in the name of the Lord Jesus</i>." Do you profess
to be in doubt as to the true intent and
meaning of the Rule? If you do, look at the
past history of the Church. Which of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
founders of Methodism favored dancing?
Did John Wesley? Did Fletcher or Clarke?
Which of them favored the theater or the
horse-race? Did Hedding, or Fisk, or Olin?
I challenge the apologists for dancing, theaters,
and races to show that a single one of
the multitude of holy men and women who
have a name in our annals ever practiced or
approved such diversions. On the contrary,
there arise from their honored graves a great
cloud of witnesses against them. The devoted
servants of God, who shine as stars in
our firmament, and whose names are "as ointment
poured forth," condemned, feared, abhorred
them as utterly at war with the life
which they were living and the work which
they were doing. Nor were these the views
of ignorant, morose, narrow-minded people,
soured by disappointment, or disabled by age
or disease, but of intelligent, happy men and
women, who served the Lord with glad hearts
and went about with smiling faces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p>Our Church traditions are unanimous in
regard to these things. The testimony which
they bear is uniform and strong. Our Bishops
and pastors are now unanimous in their
judgment. Within the past year, Conference
after Conference has spoken in resolutions
and pastoral addresses, warning our young
people on this subject. If, therefore, a young
man here and there among us finds that the
practices into which he has fallen are at variance
with the deliberate judgment of the
Wesleys, the Clarkes, the Asburys, and the
Heddings of the past, and all the Bishops
and pastors of the present day, I respectfully
suggest that he will not be liable to be convicted
of excessive modesty if he should begin
to suspect that his ideas on the subject
are wrong, nor of excessive caution if he
should conclude to refrain from indulgence
till he is better assured that it is right and
safe. Surely no one will count it a light
thing to disregard the teachings of a century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
of spiritual power and progress, nor to turn a
careless ear to the kind and faithful counsels
of those who now watch for souls.</p>

<p>2. <i>Every member of the Methodist Episcopal
Church is bound by a solemn pledge to abstain
from all questionable diversions, such as those
already named.</i></p>

<p>In the form given in the Ritual for the reception
of persons into the Church after probation,
the fourth question is in the following
words:</p>

<p>"Will you be cheerfully governed by the
Rules of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
hold sacred the ordinances of God, and endeavor,
as much as in you lies, to promote
the welfare of your brethren and the advancement
of the Redeemer's kingdom?"</p>

<p>To this question, so full of meaning, each
candidate for reception must answer, before
God and his Church, "<span class="smcap">I will</span>." (Discipline,
page 156.)</p>

<p>Every member of the Church, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
solemnly promises before God and the people
of God to be cheerfully governed by the
Rules of the Church. One of these Rules
calls upon you to avoid "such diversions as
can not be used in the name of the Lord
Jesus." That Rule has always been understood
to condemn balls and dancing, theaters,
attendance at horse-races, and the whole
list of corrupting amusements. The logical
chain, then, is complete. Every member of
the Church is bound, in the most solemn manner,
by his or her own pledge, fully and publicly
given, to abstain from balls, dancing,
theater-going, and the rest.</p>

<p>Can you, for one moment, harbor the
thought of repudiating so solemn an obligation?
The Psalmist inquires, "<i>Lord, who
shall abide in thy tabernacle? Who shall
dwell in thy holy hill?</i>" And he thus answers
his own question: "<i>He that sweareth
to his own hurt, and changeth not</i>." God
honors those who are faithful to their word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
He delights in the man who keeps his promise,
even when it is against his own temporal
interests to abide by it. If God counts it a
dishonorable and wrong thing for a man to
repudiate a pledge given to his fellow-man,
what will he think of those who repudiate a
solemn public pledge made to him? If God
honors the integrity of the man who keeps
his word when his interests seem to call upon
him to violate it, what will he say of those
who violate their word when all their interests,
both temporal and eternal, call upon
them to keep it?</p>

<p>3. <i>When the young people connected with the
Church are drawn into frivolous diversions, it
is a sorrow of heart to the pastor and to all
devoted Christians.</i></p>

<p>Will it be replied that these faithful friends
of years are so narrow and antiquated in their
notions, that no one need care what they
think or how they feel? The matter can not
be disposed of thus lightly. It is not a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
thing for a few young men and women, before
whom real life lies yet untried, to set up their
opinions, and blindly adhere to them, in opposition
to the solemn judgment of the whole
body of the ministry. It is not a small thing
to wound, deeply and wantonly, those whose
acknowledged consistency and holy lives are
the joy and crown of the Church, and one of
the main elements of its strength in the community.
It is by these, and such as they,
and God working through them, that we have
Bibles and Sabbaths, and law and order, and
civilization itself&mdash;all that exalts a Christian
country above a heathen land. These devoted
followers of Christ love his Church and
his people. Some of them have been long in
the way. They feel that they are approaching
the gates of <i>the city which hath foundations</i>,
and they are expecting daily the shadowy
messenger that shall bid them enter.
Looking to the younger members of the
Church to supply the places which they will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
soon leave vacant, they may well be troubled,
and shed their tears over the gloomy future,
when they see youthful professors of religion
given to vain and trifling pleasures and frivolous
pursuits, trying to break down the discipline
of the Church, and strip Methodism
of its beauty and its power, and wrest from
its hands the spiritual weapons with which a
thousand victories have been won.</p>

<p>4. <i>When young Church members become
giddy and fond of worldly pleasure, the unconverted
are encouraged to go on in their
sins.</i></p>

<p>They who are yet unsaved hear the ways
of wisdom described as ways of pleasantness
and peace, but they know not how to understand
the declaration. They confess that it
is good to have a hope of eternal life, just as
it is good to have a life-preserver about you
when you are going to make a sea-voyage.
Still, to them piety is a mystery. The deep
joy of devotion, the glow and the rapture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
praise, the blessedness of communion with
God they can not comprehend. They listen,
and wonder, and sometimes doubt and do not
know what to think. But when they find
that young members of the Church are just
as eager as themselves after questionable
pleasures, they conclude that these roseate
pictures of the happiness of the Christian
are, to say the least, overdone. When they
see the flock trying the fence on all sides of
the fold, and stretching their heads through
every opening, to nibble at the weeds outside,
they begin to suspect that the pasture within
is not as rich as it is represented. Thus the
inconsistent conduct of professed Christians
who plunge into worldly amusements harms
souls and injures a holy cause.</p>

<p>And sinners, too, are inconsistent with
themselves. Now they argue that religion is
all delusion, because, as they say, its professors
are no better than other people; now
they insist that their soulless pursuits must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
be right, because even members of the
Church indulge in them. Thus they seek to
justify their follies and their sins by the example
of worldly Church members. Moreover,
they will endeavor to make a little in
you justify a great deal in them. Tell a sinner
that he is not wise in attending balls,
and he will twit you with the parlor dancing
at some well-known professor's house. Warn
him against the theater, and he will ask you
to point out the moral difference between that
and the play at the museum. Tell him that
the gambling den is a dangerous place for
young men, and he will remark, with a significant
look, that living away from home he
can not play cards in his father's house, as
some do. And what professors of religion do
occasionally, the unconverted, on the strength
of their example, will claim the right to do
constantly and habitually. Thus the thoughtless
conduct of Church members is made to
increase the perils which environ the unsaved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
and to hedge up the only way of life. To incur,
or even risk, consequences like these for
the sake of a momentary excitement, is certainly
to do the devil's work for low wages.</p>

<p>5. <i>If you indulge in diversions which are
thus under condemnation, it can not fail to
lessen your religious enjoyment and mar your
usefulness.</i></p>

<p>You may seem to yourself to be confident
that your course is right, but the consciousness
that others, whose judgment you must
respect, believe it to be wrong, brings a cloud
over you. The fact that you are doing what
they condemn will haunt you in church, at
the prayer-meeting, and every-where. The
fact that you do this, not under any plea of
necessity, but for mere pastime and momentary
pleasure, will not mend matters. However
kind and considerate the older members
of the Church may be in their allusions to
your course, you feel that you have not their
confidence fully. This will trouble you, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>haps
irritate you. You fancy that you are
looked upon coldly. You detect little instances
of neglect. You imagine that certain
expressions in sermons of your pastor
or the prayers of your brethren were meant
for you. Things get worse the longer you
brood over them. You are tempted first to
stay away from the sacrament, and then to
neglect the other means of grace. Some
well-meaning but clumsy brother pounces
upon you at a most untimely moment, administers
a scathing rebuke, and goes on
his way happy, blessing the Lord that there
is one Christian left who has the courage
to do his duty. Now you are really angry.
You are ready to imagine that all the rest
of the Church would talk the same way
if they should speak their minds. Thus,
little by little, you veer from your Christian
course, the mists gather around you, the stars
disappear, you fall into adverse currents, and,
it may be, finally strike upon the rocks, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience.</p>

<p>Will you say that the evils depicted flow
not from your conduct, but from the censoriousness
of the Church? If all were silent,
the result would not be materially different.
The Methodist Episcopal Church is immovable
in her position in regard to these things.
If you violate her Discipline, you can not
shut out the thought that you are an unfaithful,
disloyal member of her communion.
This alone will suffice to bring a chill and a
blight upon you. The world, too, see that
you are not in accord with your brethren&mdash;not
at home in the place which you occupy&mdash;and
this encourages them to ply their arts to
lead you still further. If you resist, they remind
you of your own past conduct, and inquire,
perhaps with a sneer, whence comes
this sudden tenderness of conscience. If
others rebuke them, they refer to you, with
another sneer, as their exemplars. Surely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the poor pleasure which springs from questionable
diversions is bought at too high a
price when it costs us our consistency, the
warm fellowship of Christian people, peace of
conscience, and the power to do good.</p>

<p>6. <i>In morals compromises are not only treason
to truth and righteousness, but compromised
positions are of all the hardest to defend in argument
and maintain in practice.</i></p>

<p>You have acquaintances, intelligent and
agreeable, but gay and inconsiderate, who are
unwearied in their efforts to draw you into
their circle. Their importunities are urgent,
and it taxes all your powers of resistance to
withstand them. You grow weary of the
conflict between duty and inclination, and
wish for rest. The thought occurs to you
that if you go a little way with your tempters
they will be satisfied, and no great harm will
be done.</p>

<p>You reason amiss. To compromise with
wrong is never the end of conflict. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
must conquer a peace. If you do not mean
to make a complete surrender to the world,
the flesh, and the devil, there must be a point
where the line is drawn, and the stand taken.
Where will you place the line? Will you try
to draw it half way between right and wrong?
If you do you will abandon a strong position
for a weak one. If you yield in regard to
dancing in private parties, you will be invited,
in due time, to attend a ball. If you
go to see some "moral drama" performed at
the museum, you will be urged to attend the
theater. And the assault made on your halfway
position will be just as strong, the conflict
just as painful, and to refuse just as hard
as you now find it. The place of undoubted
right is at once the safest to occupy and the
easiest to maintain, and it is bad generalship
to try to intrench at any other point. And
to parley with the enemy is the next thing to
a surrender.</p>

<p>Fight it out, then, on this line. Life is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
brief, and close beyond it lie heaven and hell.
If you take one single step in the direction
of danger and ruin in search of fleeting pleasures,
will you think, ten thousand ages hence,
that in this you were wise? The foolish diversions
in which you are now importuned to
join war with health, waste time, squander
money, mar Christian reputation, dissipate
serious thought, hinder usefulness, attack every
temporal and every eternal interest. Can
you persuade yourself that it is right for you,
for the sake of an hour's feverish excitement,
to tarnish your religious example, grieve your
fellow-believers, lay a burden upon your pastor's
heart, wantonly throw away your power
to do good, and give new courage to the
wicked?</p>

<p>Will you still try to apologize for questionable
pleasures? The entire board of Bishops,
the General Conference, your pastors, without
an exception, all the deeply pious men and
women of the Church, believe that dancing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
card-playing, going to the theater and the
races are unwise, inexpedient, hurtful to the
spiritual interests of those who engage in
them, and damaging to the moral power of
the Church of God. Nor do they stand alone
in this solemn judgment. The most intelligent
and devoted Christians in the various
Churches around us share these convictions.
Will you set yourself in array against whole
Conferences, Councils, and General Assemblies?
And if you deem yourself equal in
judgment to all combined, let me ask you
another question: Is your conclusion as safe
as theirs? They think it dangerous to dance,
play cards, and attend the theater. Are you
equally confident that it is dangerous <i>not</i> to
dance, <i>not</i> to play cards, <i>not</i> to attend the
theater? Is abstinence as perilous as indulgence?
They fear that God will not hold
you guiltless if you venture into these frivolities.
Are you as fully persuaded that God
will condemn you if you do not venture into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
them? The danger is all on one side. Beware
how you venture where there is cause
for hesitation. Remember, "he that doubteth,"
and yet goes on when he might safely
stop, "is damned."</p>

<h3>APPEAL TO THE CHURCH.</h3>

<div class="center">"<i>And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean
and the clean.</i>" Ezekiel xliv, 23.</div>

<div>
<p><span class="firstword">On</span> moral and religious questions compromise
is treason to the right. Lafayette's
witty and just illustration is well
applied. He supposes two men to get into
an altercation in regard to a fact in arithmetic.
"Twice two is four," says the one,
stoutly. "No", replies the other, "twice two
is six." Both are immovable, and the dispute
waxes warm. A third person approaches,
and lays a hand gently upon each. "Gentlemen,
reason is not infallible. The wisest
men are sometimes in error. We are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
prone to rush to extremes. You, my friend,
affirm that twice two is four. You, who are
equally my friend, affirm that twice two is
six. Compromise, gentlemen, compromise.
Meet each other half way. Agree to say,
hereafter, that twice two is five."</p>

<p>Men are not lacking who, even in considering
points of morals and religion, are ready
to confess that really, after all, so far at least
as their present information extends, twice
two is somewhere about five. Nay, in their
haste to meet what they style the demands
of the age, some are ready to compromise at
five and ninety-nine hundredths. And thus,
all the way from what St. John calls "the
camp of the saints and the beloved city"
down to the place where Gog and Magog are
gathering their hosts for battle, men are
pitching their flimsy tents and raising their
equivocal banners. It is a lamentable fact
that among the chief obstacles to the progress
of the Gospel we are compelled to count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
bodies that claim to belong to the Lord Jesus
Christ, and yet have neither the heart to
preach his doctrines nor the courage to proclaim
his law. In all ages there have been
sects of nominal Christians, who form a part
of the Church of Christ in the same sense
that the outside scales of a shell-bark hickory
are a part of the tree, and who are ever ready
to compromise with the world and tolerate all
fashionable follies. Worldly men would manage
the affairs of a Church in the same manner
that they would conduct a political campaign.
The argument is, that in order to be
popular, and grow rapidly in numbers and in
wealth, the Church must lay as few restrictions
as possible upon candidates for admission,
and as seldom as possible come into
collision with the pleasures and the passions
of the multitude.</p>

<p>Mr. Bright, in a recent speech in the British
Parliament on the disestablishment of the
Irish Church, gives, in a sentence or two, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
correct description of this policy which we
have here mentioned:</p>

<p>"The Right Honorable gentleman, the member
from Bucks, argued very much in favor
of the Established Church on the ground that
there ought to be some place into which people
can get who would not readily be admitted
any where else. The fact is, what the Right
Honorable gentleman wants is this: that we
shall have an established Church which has
no discipline, and that any one who will live
up to what may be called a gentlemanly conformity
to it may pass through the world as
a very satisfactory sort of Christian."</p>

<p>But the wisdom of this world is foolishness
with God. This mercenary policy fails by
the very measures to which it resorts. When
the wicked see no distinction between the
Church and the world they cease to respect
the Church. Even the hypocrite finds his
occupation gone when a profession of religion
means nothing, just as the counterfeiter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
stops work when the bank fails and its notes
are no longer current. Thus the cunning of
men overleaps itself. On the other hand, the
Church that boldly joins issue with sin wins
moral power with every blow, and secures the
respect even of the enemy. Thus they who
feebly seek to save their lives lose them, while
those who are ready to lose life for Christ's
sake and the Gospel's find it.</p>

<p>The principle stated is of infinite importance,
and we must neither forget it nor distrust
it for an hour. All who fear God will
confess that we are not to withhold the truth
nor compromise with sin, even if the multitude
desert our altars to crowd where the
cross is lighter or its offense has wholly
ceased. But is it true that worldly craft and
policy will fail even as a policy? Let another
question answer this. Other things
being equal among rival denominations, have
not the purest in doctrine and the strictest
in morals always been the most successful?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Churches grow weak by lowering the standard
of morals. When there is no discoverable
difference between the Church and the
world, the Church is no longer loved, or venerated,
or believed. It becomes powerless to
pull down the strongholds of sin; it can no
more stir the heart, nor rouse the conscience,
nor reach the mysterious depths of our nature;
it ceases to meet the religious wants
of those whose hearts God has touched, and
men turn away unsatisfied from its shallow
waters. The scorner will be loud in his denunciations
of religionists whose vows are but
the breath of the moment, and whose professions
mean nothing. Even the soul convinced
of guilt and danger will be afraid to
trust to the guidance of a Church which has
in it so little of the divine, so little of the
power of God.</p>

<p>Methodism took at the beginning, and has
held to this day, what some might regard as
extreme positions on the subject of slavery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
worldly amusements, and the drinking customs
of the times. What is the verdict of
history? Have we damaged ourselves by our
fidelity to the right? Some timid, half-convicted
people have doubtless been repelled
from our communion by the strictness of
Methodist discipline and the boldness with
which we have assaulted the wrong, but who
believes that the Church would have grown
more rapidly by compromise and cowardice?
Who believes that it would be wise, even
according to the wisdom of this world, to
compromise with evil now? Zion is not
"lengthening her cords and strengthening
her stakes" in a Scriptural manner when she
"stretches the curtains of her tent" to shelter
dancing, card-playing, and wine-bibbing
converts. If these should come in crowds,
offering on these conditions to join us, we
could not receive them. To do so would be
to act as madly as would the general who, in
an enemy's country, commands his soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
to throw away their arms, call in the sentinels,
and level the intrenchments, in order to
gain a few timid recruits who would not wear
the uniform an hour if they thought that it
meant war.</p>

<p>Nor is our argument disproved by the history
of modern ecclesiastical organizations
which have been less rigid than our own
Church. In an intelligent community, where
the Bible is read, their laxity is always against
them. And in those very denominations the
really pious, whose influence and example are
the very salt of the body, to preserve it from
putrefaction, and without whom it would
hardly be recognized as a religious body at
all, do not join in these questionable practices
themselves, nor do they advocate them
in others.</p>

<p>The way in which the world reasons about
a facile Church is well illustrated by a conversation
which actually took place not long ago
between a sort of a minister and a shrewd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
irreligious rich man, whom he wished to get
in his little fold.</p>

<p>"Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;," said the clergyman, "almost
all your family have joined the Church, and I
think it is about time for you to do the same."</p>

<p>"O, I am not fit to join the Church. I
am not at all pious, you know," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"But", said the minister, "you are aware
that we are not very strict. Our Church
does not require as much as some others."</p>

<p>"But I am not right," said Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;. "I
sometimes get angry and swear, and that will
not do for a member of the Church."</p>

<p>"O, well," answered the minister, "you do
not mean any harm by it, do you? That
need not hinder."</p>

<p>"But, parson, that is not all. I am in business.
I trade horses, for instance, and make
the best bargain I can; and some people say
that I tell lies in making my bargains."</p>

<p>"O, well," said the parson, "it is right for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
us to take care of our interests. That need
not hinder you."</p>

<p>"Now, look here, parson," said our friend,
somewhat excited, "what good will it do me
to join your Church if I need not be any
thing but what I am? I am not a Christian
now, I know; but if I ever join the Church,
I mean to be one."</p>

<p>Even the world, unsaved, dim in vision,
and hard in heart, has learned enough of
the truth to despise those who are ready to
sacrifice religion for the sake of numbers,
and the pecuniary and social strength which
numbers bring. If the Methodist Episcopal
Church should abandon her traditions, and
retreat from her present high position in
morals, her apostasy would be attended by
a fearful loss of religious power. If such an
exhortation were allowable, I would call on
all upon whom devolves the oversight of the
Church to stand firm for the strict morals of
Methodism. There is always a difficulty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
maintaining Scriptural discipline. To enforce
it is often painful to the pastor. It sometimes
disturbs the membership and the community,
interrupting friendly intercourse and
exciting evil passions; nevertheless, we can
not give up Church order. The pressure can
be escaped only by a complete abandonment
of discipline. Concessions and compromises
merely transfer the battle to another point,
where we must again fight, our forces demoralized
by defeat and the enemy emboldened
by victory.</p>

<p>If there is any place which we can hold
against the enemy, any line where we can
muster our forces and repel invasion, it is on
the frontier. The king who fails to meet his
foes the moment they set foot within his territory
is already conquered. Drawing the
line, and taking her stand in favor of total
abstinence from all that intoxicates, the Methodist
Episcopal Church has kept herself pure
from the sin and shame of intemperance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
yet not one in ten thousand of her members
is ever arraigned for violation of the
stringent rule. Could the Church tolerate
what is called "moderate drinking" without
being compelled to deal with multitudes
whom moderate drinking had led into the
depths of drunkenness? For the same reason
it is easier to keep our young people
from objectionable diversions than to discipline
them for the grosser inconsistencies
into which indulgence would speedily lead
them.</p>

<p>Will it be said that if we are so rigid our
young people will leave us and join other
communions? Be it so, if it must. They
who are in haste to sell their membership in
the Church for so poor and small a mess of
pottage can do us little good if they remain.
<i>They go out from us because they are not of
us.</i> A thousand dancing, wine-bibbing, card-playing,
theater-going Church members will
not furnish one worthy candidate for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
Christian ministry, not one devoted class-leader,
not one pious man or woman ready
for the spiritual work of the Church of God.
If they leave us in order to seek a more congenial
home, we can better afford to lose than
to keep them. The rubbing out of minus
quantities increases the sum total. And if
any other Church, so called, imagine that
they can make their swarm the stronger by
hiving our drones, they are certainly welcome
to try the experiment. If there be a noble
emulation that may justly prompt us to "labor
more abundantly" than others, and excel
them if we may, in Gospel successes, we need
not fear the rivalry of any fashionable, worldly,
easy-going denomination. Such as these will
never "take our crown." Pure doctrine, a
faithful ministry, unwavering adherence to the
Divine law of morals, a devoted, holy, earnest
laity, alone will win the prize.</p>

<p>But let us not flatter ourselves with the
idea of a vantage-ground which no one else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
has the wisdom to see nor the grace to occupy.
No low degree of morality will suffice
to place us at the head of the sacramental
host, or even give us a position among the
leaders. Others as well as ourselves see the
beauty of holiness, and are striving to put
on the robe "white and clean" which is
"the righteousness of saints." Almost every
branch of the Church of Christ has taken
the alarm, and, by its leading ministers or
resolutions passed in ecclesiastical councils,
has spoken emphatic words of warning. It
would be easy to fill scores of pages with
these utterances, coming from Churches differing
widely in doctrine and in usage. A
few extracts, with the sources whence they
emanate, will show us the sentiments and
convictions of the general Church in our
whole land.</p>

<p>The General Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church thus spoke half a century ago:</p>

<p>"On the fashionable though, as we believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
dangerous amusements of theatrical exhibitions
and dancing, we deem it necessary to
make a few observations. The theater we
have always considered as a school of immorality....
With respect to dancing, we
think it necessary to observe that however
plausible it may appear to some, it is perhaps
not the less dangerous on account of that
plausibility.... Let it once be introduced
and it is difficult to give it limits. It steals
away precious time, dissipates religious impressions,
and hardens the heart."</p>

<p>The General Assembly of 1865 reaffirmed
the action of the session of 1818, condemned
card-playing&mdash;to which attention had been
called by a memorial&mdash;and "affectionately exhorted
all the members of the Church" to
avoid "all recreations and amusements which
are calculated to impair spirituality, lessen
Christian influence, or bring discredit upon
them in their profession as members of a
Christian Church."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Bishop M'Ilvaine, of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, thus declares his judgment on
the same subject:</p>

<p>"Let me now turn to two objects, in which
there is no difficulty of discrimination&mdash;the
theater and the dance. The only line I would
draw in regard to these is that of entire exclusion.
And yet, my brethren, I am well
aware how easy it is for the imagination to
array both of these in such an abstract and
elementary simplicity, so divested of all that
gives them their universal character and
relish, that no harm could be detected in
either. And the same precisely can be easily
done with the card-table and horse-race."</p>

<p>Bishop Mead, also of the Protestant Episcopal
Church, thus condemns dancing:</p>

<p>"As an amusement, seeing that it is a perversion
of an ancient religious exercise, and
has ever been discouraged by the sober-minded
and pious of all nations, on account
of its evil tendencies and accompaniments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
we ought conscientiously to inquire whether
its great liability to abuse, and its many acknowledged
abuses, should not make us frown
upon it <i>in all its forms</i>. I will briefly allude
to some of the objections to it. When taught
to the young at an early age, it is attended
with an expense of time and money which
might be far better employed. It promotes
the love of dress and pleasure, to which the
young are already too prone; it tempts to
vanity and love of display; it induces a
strong desire to enter on the amusements of
the world at an early period, in order to exhibit
the accomplishments thus acquired, and
to enjoy a pleasure for which a taste has been
formed; it leads the young ones exactly into
an opposite direction to that pointed out in
the Word of God."</p>

<p>In their Episcopal Address of 1867, the
Bishops of the Methodist Episcopal Church
South thus speak:</p>

<p>"This is no time to abate our testimony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
against worldliness in all its forms. Our
Church has never faltered in its teaching or
modified its tone in relation to dancing, theaters,
the manufacture and sale of ardent spirits,
drunkenness, revelings, and such like, as
demoralizing and fatal to godliness. Now
that we are threatened with these evils coming
in like a flood, we renew our warning."</p>

<p>In 1866 the Young Men's Christian Association
held a General Convention in Albany,
New York. Delegates were present from all
parts of the United States and the British
Provinces. The question of amusements
was carefully considered, and the conclusion
reached was set forth in a formal resolution,
thus:</p>

<p>"That we bear our energetic testimony
against dancing, card and billiard-playing, as
so distinctively worldly in their associations,
and unspiritual in their influences, as to be
utterly inconsistent with our profession as the
disciples of Christ."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>And last of all, but not least in the wisdom
of the sentiments uttered, nor in the faithfulness
of its warnings, we cite the Pastoral Letter
of the Provincial Council of Baltimore,
the voice of the Bishops of the Roman Catholic
Church. It is dated May, 1869:</p>

<p>"The dangerous amusements, prominent
among the evils we have to deplore, and
which is an evidence of the growing licentiousness
of the times, may be reckoned a
morbid taste for indecent publications, and
the frequency of immoral or positively obscene
theatrical performances. No entertainments
seem sufficient to satisfy the fast degenerating
spirit of the age unless they be
highly sensational, and calculated to gratify
the most prurient appetites. We can hardly
say who deserve a stronger condemnation,
the actors who pander to the most vitiated
tastes, or the audiences who encourage, by
their presence, and applaud these grossly indelicate
exhibitions. Both actors and spec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>tators
appear to vie with each in their rapid
march down the slippery path of sin. We
deem it particularly our solemn duty to renew
our warning against the modern fashionable
dances, commonly called 'German,' or round
dances, which are becoming more and more
the occasions of sin. These practices are so
much the more dangerous as most persons
seem to look upon them as harmless, and indulge
in them without any apparent remorse
of conscience. But Divine revelation, the
wisdom of antiquity, the light of reason and
of experience, all concur in proclaiming that
this kind of entertainments can not be indulged
in by any virtuous persons, unless
they be more than human, without detriment
to their souls, or even be present to take
part in such amusements, where the eye is
dazzled by an array of fascinating objects,
where the senses are captivated by enchanting
music, and the heart is swayed to and fro
amid the surrounding gayety and excitement."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>With these facts, arguments, appeals, and
testimonies we leave the subject to the solemn
consideration of the reader, believing
that the position which we have taken is rational,
Scriptural, and safe, "by manifestation
of the truth commending" itself "to every
man's conscience in the sight of God."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Finally, brethren, whatsoever things
are true, whatsoever things are honest,
whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
things are pure, whatsoever things are
lovely, whatsoever things are of good
report; if there be any virtue and if
there be any praise, think on these
things.</span>"</p>
